Clinical Practice Review Assessment and management of acute pain in cats Sheilah A. Robertson, BVMS (Hons), PhD, DACVA Abstract: Cats are popular pets, but until recently, their peri-operative and traumatic pain had been seriously underestimated and under-treated. The lack of treatment stems from difﬁculty in recognizing pain, lack of licensed analgesic drugs, fear of toxic side effects, and lack of information specific to cats. Fortunately, in the last decade, many advances have been made in feline analgesia. It is now obvious that because of the cat’s unique metabolism, species-specific studies are essential. Opioids are the mainstay of any analgesic protocol for acute pain and can be used with few side effects. Other drugs that can be utilized include the a2-agonists, local anesthetics, and non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs. Pain assessment in cats is challenging and developing, and validating pain scoring systems remains an important goal. The information in this article will help the critical care and emergency clinician formulate a safe and effective analgesic plan for feline patients.

Of note is that cats recently overtook dogs as the most popular pet with current numbers estimated at between 70 and 77.7 million in the United States alone. Concur- rent with this has been a long awaited increase in the publication of studies relevant to assessment and alle- viation of pain in this species which has previously lagged behind the information available for dogs. How- ever, feline practitioners are still faced with several challenges including the cat’s
unique metabolism of many drugs and the lack of licensed analgesic drugs. In the ﬁeld of emergency medicine, the veterinarian will deal primarily with acute pain that may be related to trauma, non-elective surgical procedures, or medical diseases. Acute pain has a wide variety of causes and sources (soft tissue, orthopedic, ocular, somatic, viscer- al), variable intensity (from minor lacerations to mul- tiple fractures, acute peritonitis, or pancreatitis), and expected duration (days to weeks), which may all re- quire a different approach to treatment. The aim of this paper is to review current knowledge of acute pain assessment in cats, and the most useful drugs and techniques for its alleviation. What Is Pain and How Do We Measure It? Pain is a complex, multidimensional experience in- volving both sensory and affective components. All mammals possess the neuroanatomic and neurophar- macologic components necessary for transduction, transmission, and perception of noxious stimuli (no- ciception). A recent consensus statement indicated that animals are capable of emotions and, therefore, do ex- perience pain, although it is unclear whether all species, including humans, feel pain with the same qualities and intensities.2 Cats are under-treated for pain.3–6 When veterinari- ans were asked their opinion on an exploratory laparo- tomy in dogs and cats, they considered this procedure equally painful in both species, yet only 56% of cats received analgesics compared with 71% of dogs.5 To overcome this bias, we must understand why cats come in second in the pain stakes. The reason for under- treating feline pain is not lack of compassion by care- givers. The most often cited reasons for withholding analgesics from cats are difﬁculty in recognizing and assessing pain, the limited number of analgesics with market authorization, lack of published information, and the fear of adverse side effects.5 Address correspondence and reprint requests

In 2003, the American Animal Hospital Association introduced pain management standards that must be met for ac- creditation and a mandate is that pain must be assessed in all patients regardless of the presenting problem. This is one of the biggest challenges feline practitioners face. We must know ﬁrst if they do indeed hurt and, if so, how much. To assess pain in animals, we must ob- serve them carefully and know what behaviors indicate pain; by definition, this is subjective and, compared with humans and young children who can communi- cate, there is more room for error. Put simply, in hu- mans, pain is what the patient says it is and in animals it is what we decide it is. Currently, there is no gold standard for assessing pain in animals. The issue in animals is complex because we must consider differences in species-specific responses to pain, but even within a species there is considerable variation. Few veterinarians would disagree that the different temperaments of individual cats complicates the picture. Investigators looking for objective measure of pain have failed to ﬁnd a good correlation between physiologic variables (respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure) or plasma cortisol levels and pain scores in cats because these are inﬂuenced by many factors other than pain.7–9 Changes in wound sensitivity have cor- related well with
visual analog pain scores in cats10 suggesting that palpation, which is a simple clinically applicable technique, is a valuable tool and should be incorporated into an overall assessment protocol. In an emergency clinic, a pain scoring system must be simple and quick to perform, but be valid, reliable, and sensitive. Observation of behavior is undoubted- ly the best means of assessing the degree of pain ex- perienced by a cat11; however, in the emergency setting, the veterinarian may have had no prior contact with the cat and will require the owner’s input on what is normal for that particular patient. More information can be gathered if you ﬁrst observe the cat from a dis- tance, then assess its response to a person’s approach, and ﬁnally interact with it by stroking it and palpat- ing the wound or area you suspect is painful.7 Use of a dynamic interactive visual analog scale (DIVAS) by one individual unaware of treatments detected both differences between 2 analgesics and between treated and untreated cats.12 Acute pain related to trau- ma may result in a depressed, immobile, and silent cat that is tense, distanced from its environment and that tries to hide and does not respond to stroking or atten- tion. Alternatively, cats can be manic and aggressive, growling, hissing, and rolling around their cage; these are difﬁcult patients to assess and treat and are dis- cussed later. Cats with abdominal pain adopt a hunched sternal posture, with their head hung lower than their body, elbows drawn back, stiﬂes forward and abdominal muscles tensed. Cats may lick, chew, and self-mutilate an injured area and this is documented following on- ychectomy.13 If part of the treatment involves bandag- ing or taping, the observer must differentiate between pain and the dislike of restrictive dressings. Levy et al.14 reported
that bandages alone caused a 200% increase in urine cortisol, suggesting that cats ﬁnd this stressful. Cats that are comfortable can perform normal functions including stretching, back arching, climbing into a litter box, grooming and adopting normal postures such as laying curled up in lateral recumbency. Regardless of the scoring system adopted, it should become part of the routine assessment – temperature, pulse, respiration, and pain score (‘TPRP’). Analgesic intervention should restore normal behavior and lower the pain score. Why Treat Pain? Treating pain has obvious welfare beneﬁts but also many other less obvious dividends pertinent to trau- matized or critically ill cats. These include better car- diovascular stability, decreased metabolic and hormonal responses, and less catabolism and immuno- suppression.15 Surgical or accidental trauma results in primary (at the site of injury) and secondary (at sites distant to the injury) nociceptive sensitization that can lead to prolonged and intensiﬁed pain.16,17 The beneﬁts of pre-emptive analgesia in limiting central sensitizat- ion and ‘wind-up’ has been a controversial topic in human medicine but can be demonstrated.18 In ani- mals, there is good evidence that this is a worthwhile strategy19,20 and data in cats are encouraging.21 In emergency practice, the patient is often not seen until already in pain, but early intervention is still beneﬁcial – the longer it takes before initiating an analgesic plan, the harder it becomes to achieve relief. Drug Strategies for Alleviating Acute Pain There are several factors to consider when choosing an analgesic drug for feline patients, including the unique metabolism of cats, availability of species-specific data including both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacody- namic proﬁle of the drug, and also ease of administra- tion (Table 1). Hepatic metabolism Cats have a reputation for adverse drug reactions; some of these are warranted and others are not. Cats have a
low capacity for hepatic glucuronidation of exogenou- & Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2005, doi: 10.1111/j.1476-4431.2005.00172.x 262 S.A. Robertson sly administered drugs which has a molecular genetic basis.22–24 Domestic cats have fewer hepatic UDP- glucuroninosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms, and muta- tions of UGT and pseudogenes have been identiﬁed by cloning techniques. Exposure to plants that contain phytoalexins stimulate development of these pathways but cats have historically been obligate carnivores and this may, in part, explain the differences between spe- cies. These metabolic differences can lead to toxic side effects if doses and dosing intervals are not adjusted. In contrast, if the parent compound must be metabolized to an active component via this pathway, the drug may be less effective. Deﬁcient glucuronidation pathways explain the cat’s susceptibility to the adverse side ef- fects of phenolic drugs such as acetaminophen (para- cetamol) and long half lives of other drugs such as carprofen25,26 and salicylates.26,27 Cats produce very small amounts of the active metabolite morphine-6- glucuronide (M-6-G) which contributes to the overall analgesic proﬁle of morphine; this may explain why morphine seems less effective in cats compared with other species.28 Drugs The analgesic drugs that are most useful to the critical care and emergency clinician are the opioids, a2-ago- nists, and local anesthetics. The NMDA receptor an- tagonist, ketamine, has been used extensively in cats for chemical restraint but may also have analgesic actions. With care, the non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also have a place for acute pain management. Table 1: Drugs that can be used in cats for the treatment of acute pain.

The lethal dose of individual opioids is not well documented in the cat, but in the rat, the median lethal dose of mor- phine is 64 mg/kg and for buprenorphine it is 234 mg,29 which is 32 and over 4000 times the recommended an- algesic dose, respectively. The safety of opioids is also enhanced by their reversibility with drugs such as naloxone or naltrexone. Butorphanol, buprenorphine, fentanyl, meperidine (pethidine), morphine, hydromor- phone, and oxymorphone have all been used clinically in cats.11,30 Butorphanol is classiﬁed as an agonist-an- tagonist (having a ceiling effect), buprenorphine as a partial agonist, and the others are opioid agonists. The opioid agonists have a linear dose–response and can be titrated to effect. Buprenorphine behaves like an opioid agonist and the so-called ‘bell-shaped’ curve is not seen at clinical doses. It is a misconception that cats are at a high risk of excitement or ‘morphine mania’ following opioid administration. Such reports were based on ear- ly literature when excessive doses (20 mg/kg of mor- phine) were administered.31,32 Recent studies show that with appropriate dosing the behavioral effects usually include euphoria, with purring, rolling, and kneading with the front paws.33–36 One exception is butorphanol which has been associated with dysphoric behavior.37 An elevated body temperature is a concern in a sick or injured cat as the cause may be infection, administra- tion of certain drugs or overzealous warming and the cause must be identiﬁed so that the
correct treatment can be started. The practitioner should also be aware of opioid-related hyperthermia in cats. At doses of mor- phine 41 mg/kg, cats may become hyperthermic38 and meperidine at 3 times clinically recommended doses resulted in temperatures as high as 41.7 1C (107 1F).39 This phenomenon appears to be dose related, but even at commonly used clinical doses, some opioids may result in elevated body temperature. In a retrospective clinical study (Niedfeldt and Robertson, unpublished data), there was a strong association between the use of hydromorphone (at 0.05–1.0 mg/kg intramuscular [IM] or intravenous [IV]) and hyperthermia. Some of these cats had received only 1 dose, and others 2 or more. Rectal temperatures over 40 1C (104 1F) were recorded in 75% of the cats that received hydromorphone and a peak temperature of 42.5 1C (108.5 1F) occurred in 1 cat. Temperatures over 40.5 1C (105 1F) are cause for con- cern and may respond to external cooling such as fans and application of cool water to the fur. However, higher temperatures are potentially life- threatening and in the study by Niedfeldt (2004, unpublished), 2 cats were open-mouth breathing and panting with body temperatures over 41.5 1C (107 1F). These cats responded quickly to naloxone but this op- ioid antagonist also reverses the analgesic effects of hydromorphone. The high incidence of hyperthermia at clinical doses has greatly reduced the use of hydro- morphone in the author’s clinical practice. Cats treated with a transdermal fentanyl (TDF) patch had higher rectal temperatures than those given but- orphanol.40 Opioids cause marked mydriasis in cats; this may cause them to bump into objects and they may not see a handler approaching. For these reasons, approach slowly while talking to the cat so it is not startled. Al- so, keep them out of bright light
while their pupils are dilated. Nausea, vomiting, and salivation can be seen after morphine and hydromorphone injection but is un- common after buprenorphine, meperidine, or but- orphanol.33,34,41 The incidence of nausea and vomiting is also related to the route of administration; subcuta- neous (SQ) hydromorphone results in a higher inci- dence of vomiting than the IV or IM route.41 When administered to painful cats or in combination with acepromazine, the incidence of opioid-induced vomit- ing is considerably less. Specific opioids Butorphanol is a m antagonist, which produces analge- sia through its k agonist activity. It is commonly used in cats in North America, and is generally given at doses from 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg.3 More recently, its analgesic properties have been called into question in both dogs and cats.42 Butorphanol exhibits a ‘ceiling’ effect after which increasing the dose does not produce any further analgesia.37,43 Butorphanol appears to be an effective visceral, but poor somatic analgesic.43 Both clinical studies and experimental investigations indicate that butorphanol is short acting (o90 minutes)34,43 and re- quires frequent dosing to be effective. Butorphanol is a poor analgesic choice in the face of both somatic and visceral pain, but would be a reasonable choice for acute visceral pain such as that associated with acute cystitis or enteritis. Meperidine is only given by the IM or SQ route be- cause of reports of excitement after IV dosing. In clin- ical studies (3.3–10 mg/kg IM), it appears to have a fast onset but short duration of action12,44 and research studies suggest that at a dose of 5 mg/kg its duration of action is less that 1 hour.33 Morphine has been widely used in cats and doses of 0.1–0.2 mg/kg are effective in clinical cases and do not cause excitement.11 Both clinically11 and in research models34 onset of
action is slow. Morphine appears less effective in cats compared with dogs and this may be & Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2005, doi: 10.1111/j.1476-4431.2005.00172.x 264 S.A. Robertson related to their limited production of the active morphine metabolites morphine-6-glucuronide45 which may contribute significantly to morphine’s overall an- algesic effect in humans.46 Oxymorphone has been a popular analgesic for many years in the USA.35,47,48 Using a visceral pain model, Briggs et al.48 reported that a combination of oxymor- phone and butorphanol produced a greater degree of analgesia than either drug used alone and that this could be further enhanced by adding acepromazine. Clinically, oxymorphone does not appear to be associ- ated with hyperthermia and is effective for many dif- ferent types of pain with duration of effect of 2–4 hours. Hydromorphone has become popular in veterinary medicine and has, to a great extent, replaced oxymor- phone because it is less expensive.49 Doses of 0.05– 0.2 mg/kg of hydromorphone are generally recom- mended.49 The relationship between dose and thermal antinociception (a measure of analgesia) of IV hydro- morphone administration has been studied in cats. At doses of 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg there was a small in- crease in thermal antinociception of short duration [Robertson, unpublished observations]. An IV dose of 0.1 mg/kg produced a substantial increase in thermal antinociception for up to 7 hours.50 Route of adminis- tration has a significant effect on quality and duration of analgesia and side effects. When the analgesic and side effects of 0.1 mg/kg given by the IV, IM, or SQ route were compared, the IV route produced the great- est intensity and duration of antinociceptive effect with the least incidence of vomiting and salivation.41 In contrast to the study by Briggs et al.48 a combi- nation of hydromorphone (0.1 mg/kg IM) and but- orphanol
(0.4 mg/kg IM) did not have additive effects on thermal antinociception, but rather produced a longer lasting (up to 9 hours) but less intense effect than hydromorphone alone.51 Buprenorphine is the most popular opioid used in small animals practice in the UK5 and is also widely used in the rest of Europe, Australia, and South Afri- ca.4,6 In research cats, it has been studied after IM,34 IV, and oral transmucosal (OTM)52 administration. IM dos- es of 0.01 mg/kg resulted in a slow onset (2 hours) of analgesia with a variable duration ranging from 4 to 12 hours.34 Systemic uptake of buprenorphine after OTM dosing is almost 100% complete53 in cats. The pH of the cat’s mouth is between 8 and 9, which would enhance absorption, and this may explain the effectiveness of this route in cats compared with other species with a neutral oral pH.53 There was no difference in onset of analgesia (within 30 minutes), time to peak effect (90 minutes) or duration of action (6 hours) when 0.02 mg/ kg was administered by the IV or OTM route in re- search cats.52 In clinical studies, buprenorphine produced better analgesia than morphine in cats undergoing a variety of soft tissue and orthopedic procedures,54 was superior to oxymorphone for sterilization (with or without on- ychectomy)35 and provided longer pain relief than me- peridine (pethidine) following ovariohysterectomy.55 Buprenorphine rarely causes vomiting or dysphoria and has not been associated with hyperthermia (Ni- edfeldt and Robertson, unpublished data). There is very little information in the veterinary lit- erature about the effect of organ dysfunction on the metabolism of opioids. In humans with severe renal impairment, the metabolism of buprenorphine follow- ing single dosing or infusions was little affected and although metabolite concentrations increased these are unlikely to have significant pharmacological actions.56 The effect
of buprenorphine on gastrointestinal activity is discussed later. Fentanyl is a potent, short acting pure m agonist which is commonly used as a constant rate infusion (CRI).30 In a cat specific study, 10 mg/kg IV provided rapid onset (peak action o5 minutes) of significant an- algesia that lasted 110 minutes, with no excitement, salivation or vomiting.36 In that study, plasma fentanyl concentrations and analgesia were closely correlated and it was concluded that at a plasma value of 41.07 ng/mL fentanyl provides analgesia, which is similar to that reported for dogs57 and humans.58 This data should be the basis of formulating more rational CRI and target controlled infusion protocols for cats. Transdermal delivery systems In the critical care setting, there has been great interest in transdermal delivery of drugs because they may of- fer a ‘hands off’ approach to pain management and could provide a constant delivery of drug thereby avoiding peaks and troughs seen with intermittent bolus administration. A transdermal (matrix patch) delivery system for buprenorphine is now available for use in humans (Transtec).a In cats, there is systemic uptake after ap- plication of a 35 mg/h patch but plasma concentrations were very variable and over a 4-day period, no effective analgesia was demonstrated.59,60 The transdermal fentanyl (TDF) patch has been used for acute perioperative pain in cats.40,61,62 Plasma fent- anyl concentrations are variable after patch placement in cats40,61 and in one study,63 2 out of 6 cats never achieved plasma fentanyl concentrations above 1 ng/mL. Factors affecting plasma levels include the size of the patch compared with the weight of the cat, skin permeability, and body temperature. In critical care patients, hypo- thermia, hypovolemia, and decreased skin perfusion will decrease absorption.

During the uptake phase, other opioids must be administered to provide analgesia and all, except butorphanol, could be used. TDF patches have proved useful in a clinical setting.40,61,62 The use of various drugs compounded in transdermal creams has become popular in veterinary medicine de- spite the lack of scientific studies.67 Fentanyl compound- ed in pluronic lecithin organogel failed to be absorbed through the skin of the inner pinna or dorsum of the shaved neck of cats even after a dose of 30 mg/kg, there- fore, these formulations cannot be recommended.36 Although not classiﬁed as an opioid, tramadol has weak binding afﬁnity at m-receptors and is thought to activate monoaminergic spinal inhibition of pain. In dogs, this drug shows promise for acute pain.68 A dose of 1–2 mg/kg IV has been suggested for cats, but there are as yet no published reports of controlled clinical studies. The morphology and sequencing of feline opioid re- ceptors has not been extensively studied69 but marked inter-cat variation in analgesic response to butorphanol has been reported37 suggesting that cats also express genetic variability. This highlights the importance of careful assessment of pain in cats as one analgesic at a set dose is unlikely to be equally effective in all patients even with
the same injury. a2-adrenoceptor agonists Medetomidine is not licensed for use in cats in the USA but is in several other countries. Medetomidine pro- vides dose-related sedation, muscle relaxation, and an- algesia in cats70 and can be excellent in an emergency setting as it provides reliable sedation and will allow the clinician to perform a clinical examination, take ra- diographs and perform minor procedures such as bandaging and jugular catheter placement. However, the main concern with its use in a critical care setting is its cardiovascular effects. Although doses of between 40 and 150 mg/kg have been recommended, clinical experience shows that 20 mg/kg IM provides reliable sedation and analgesia for up to 1 hour. However, even this lower dose causes a significant decrease in cardiac output, stroke volume, and heart rate71 Bradycardia and decreased stroke vol- ume contribute to the decrease in cardiac output which is substantial, dropping from a mean of 1.3 to 0.49 L/ min 15 minutes after treatment; this is accompanied by a 3-fold increase in systemic vascular resistance.71 At 10 mg/kg IM, medetomidine caused a drop in ejection fraction from a mean of 55 to 43% and a 25% decrease in peak ventricular ﬁlling rate.72 Some authors have cau- tioned against the use of medetomidine in cats with cardiac disease,72 whereas others have suggested it may be beneﬁcial in cats with left ventricular hypertrophy and outﬂow obstruction.73 In human medicine, there is great interest in the use of a2-agonists where low doses of dexmedetomidine have provided excellent sedation, reduced opioid require- ments and maintained respiratory and cardiovascular stability in intensive care settings.74 Dexmedetomidine usage has been reported in cats, and combined with ketamine or butorphanol, minimal cardiovascular effects were reported75 but because of expense, this drug is not widely used clinically. The future success of
medetomidine in veterinary clinical practice lies with the use of so-called ‘micro- doses’ in the range of 1–5 mg/kg (IVor IM)76 or as a CRI (1–2 mg/kg/hour) with or without opioids but critical evaluation of the cardiovascular effects of these proto- cols have not been undertaken in cats. The actions of medetomidine can be reversed with at- ipamezole76 and certainly the ability to antagonize po- tentially dangerous cardiovascular complications or inadvertent overdose is an advantage. However, in dogs, rapid reversal with IV atipamezole may induce hypo- tension,77 therefore, unless it is a life-threatening situa- tion, the IM route should be used or the dose can be given by slow (over 2–3 minutes) IV titration until the desired effect is achieved. This latter technique can be used to maintain mild sedation and analgesia. If mede- tomidine is used the patient’s temperature should be monitored as hypothermia can occur.76 Xylazine results in hypoinsulinemia and hyperglycemia and although the endocrine effects of medetomidine in the cat are not well documented it should be avoided in diabetic patients. Medetomidine induces vomiting in a high percentage of cats78 so should not be used when an increase in intra- ocular or intracranial pressure must be avoided. A fur- ther side effect of the a2-agonists is profound diuresis. Medetomidine is best reserved for use in previously healthy cats that require sedation following acute trau- ma, for example a fracture where blood loss is not an issue. Medetomidine should not be given to cats with cardiovascular disease, pre-existing hypovolemia, or head trauma. Local anesthetics Local anesthetics can be used for regional blockade (epidural analgesia), to block specific nerves (intercos- & Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2005, doi: 10.1111/j.1476-4431.2005.00172.x 266 S.A. Robertson tal, limbs), and inﬁltrated into wounds or fractures (surgical or traumatic).30,79 The value of these tech-
niques is underestimated in trauma and surgery pa- tients where they can provide complete analgesia with minimal side effects and whenever possible the clini- cian should use local anesthetics. Lamont30 offers a good review of techniques including brachial plexus block. A particularly useful technique is to implant a ‘soaker’ catheter into a wound (for example, large lac- eration, degloving injury, post-amputation wound) to provide a method for maintaining continuous analge- sia. Lidocaine (2–4 mg/kg) can be repeated every 2–3 hours or as needed based on wound palpation. Bupivacaine is longer acting and 2 mg/kg would be expected to last 4–5 hours. Both these drugs can be diluted with sterile saline to provide a suitable volume. Some authors recommend a combination of lidocaine plus bupivacaine to achieve a fast onset and longer duration of action; in this case the total dose of local anesthetic should not exceed 2 mg/kg. Topical anesthetic creams can be applied to shaved skin to provide analgesia for venipuncture, large-bore catheter placement, bone marrow aspiration or a vari- ety of other critical care procedures. The 2 commercially available agents are an over-the-counter liposome-en- capsulated formulation of lidocaine (ELA-Max s, LMXt)b and a prescription only mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine (EMLA s cream).c Transdermal absorp- tion did occur after application of 15 mg/kg of ELA- Max s, but plasma concentrations remained signiﬁcant- ly below toxic values.80 There was no systemic uptake of the components of EMLA s cream and its use sub- jectively eliminated the usual signs of discomfort seen with jugular catheter placement.81 In dogs, systemic lidocaine infusion has shown ben- eﬁcial effects as an analgesic in surgery patients82 and as an anesthetic sparing technique with no adverse cardiovascular effects.83,84 In cats, increasing plasma concentrations of lidocaine caused a dose-dependant decrease in isoﬂurane requirements.85 Despite a signif-
icant reduction in the dose of inhalant agent, lidocaine produced more cardiovascular depression than an equipotent dose of isoﬂurane alone and was associat- ed with an increase in blood lactate concentration86 and, for these reasons, cannot be recommended in cats. This study emphasizes once again the importance of species-specific studies. Epidural drugs Opioids, a2-agonists, local anesthetics, or combinations of these drugs can be administered via the epidural route in cats. Opioids exert their major analgesic effect in the dor- sal horn of the spinal cord and intrathecal or epidural administration provides long lasting analgesia with fewer systemic side effects. Morphine (0.1 mg/kg), fentanyl (4 mg/kg), meperidine (pethidine), and meth- adone have been used successfully via the epidural route in cats87–92 with morphine being the most clini- cally useful in terms of analgesia achieved, duration of action and lack of side effects. In 1 study, 2 out of 23 cats that received epidural morphine had urinary reten- tion.92 Lidocaine or bupivacaine are often co-adminis- tered with an opioid to enhance analgesia.30 Epidural administration of medetomidine (10 mg/kg) was found it to be superior to fentanyl (4 mg/kg)90 and systemic effects were mild and short lived.89 Epidural techniques may be an option for cats with tail, abdominal, pelvic or hind-limb pain, or that re- quire surgery at these sites. Opioids alone can provide good thoracic analgesia with minimal systemic effects. Epidural injection is technically more challenging in cats because of their small size and because the spinal cord ends more caudally; entering the subarachnoid space is more likely. If this occurs, half of the epidural dose may still be administered.30 Ketamine Ketamine is a non-competitive antagonist of the N-me- thyl-D-aspartate receptor that has been implicated in central sensitization. In human medicine, ketamine is being re-examined for its analgesic potential.93 In dogs, sub-anesthetic
doses of ketamine (2.5 mg/kg) given preoperatively provided better postoperative analgesia than the same dose given at the end of surgery94 and low dose ketamine infusion in dogs after major surgery is opioid sparing.20 Ketamine is widely used in cats as a dissociative an- esthetic agent, but there is little information on its role as an analgesic. One study demonstrated a weak vis- ceral analgesic effect95 and anesthetic protocols that in- corporate ketamine provide better postoperative analgesia than those without.21 Low dose ketamine (2 mg/kg IV) produced excellent sedation in cats with an initial increase in thermal an- tinociception but after sedation had worn off there was a delayed onset of significant hyperalgesia or allodynia when even handling and stroking the cats prompted aversive behavior.96,97 It should be noted that in these studies cats did not undergo any painful procedures. Ketamine can only inhibit NMDA receptors if they have been opened by a noxious stimulus98 and this may explain the difference between the use of ketamine to sedate pain-free cats compared with those in pain or undergoing surgery. The beneﬁts of using low doses or infusions of ketamine in cats to alleviate pain warrants further study. & Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2005, doi: 10.1111/j.1476-4431.2005.00172.x 267 Acute pain in feline patients Cerebellar dysfunction following general anesthesia is reported to be linked to the use of ketamine in Persian cross cats99 but anecdotally happens in other breeds and mixed breeds. The cause is unknown, but can range from mild to severe and is usually permanent. NSAIDs The use of this group of analgesics in cats has recently been reviewed.100 They can provide up to 24 hours of analgesia, and are not subject to the legal regulations of opioids. Although several are licensed for use in cats in other countries, only
one (injectable meloxicam) is in this class are currently labeled for feline use in the United States. These drugs act to inhibit cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes and because there is considerable species var- iation in COX expression, the efﬁcacy and safety of a drug in one species cannot be assumed in another. It was believed that COX-1 was responsible for normal homeostatic functions such as maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity, platelet function, and renal autoreg- ulation, while COX-2 was associated with inﬂamma- tion. The development of COX-2 selective NSAIDs was hailed as a breakthrough in preventing toxicity from these drugs, but continued reports of problems associ- ated with their use suggest that the simple COX-1/ COX-2 concept is ﬂawed and much more complex than previously believed. It is now known that in some spe- cies constitutive COX-2 is produced in the kidney and central nervous system and is required for normal function. As a group, NSAIDs have a lower safety margin than opioids or a2-agonists and are not reversible. There is potential for NSAID toxicity in cats since their limited ability to glucuronidate exogenous drugs results in prolonged duration of effect with the potential for drug accumulation. The mean half-life of carprofen in cats is approximately 20 hours, twice that of the dog, but can vary from as short as 9 hours up to 49 hours.25,26 The use of carprofen, meloxicam and ketoprofen is well documented in cats.12,44,55,101,102 As in other species, the contraindications to NSAID use are gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding, platelet dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and concurrent cortico- steroid use. Renal autoregulation is prostaglandin de- pendant in the face of hypotension and NSAIDs must not be given in the face of volume depletion (vomiting, diarrhea, hemorrhage, or other ﬂuid losses) or in situ- ations such as sepsis where low blood
pressure is likely or has been conﬁrmed. Cats appear to be particularly susceptible to the adverse renal effects of NSAIDs. In some situations, for example, the stable norm- ovolemic trauma patient, these drugs can be valuable for alleviating acute pain. Carprofen has a long history in the United Kingdom where the injectable formula- tion (4 mg/kg) is licensed for a single treatment. How- ever, clinically there seems little beneﬁt of the 4 mg/kg dose over 2 mg/kg,12 and the lower dose is recom- mended. There have been reports of gastrointestinal toxicity generally associated with concurrent disease and prolonged administration of the oral formula- tion.103 Problems with repeated dosing are likely a re- sult of individual variation in pharmacokinetics. Meloxicam is a COX-2 selective NSAID that is avail- able as an injectable and oral formulation. In the USA, only the injectable formulation (0.3 mg/kg) is approved for cats and for one dose only. Its use at lower doses (0.1–0.2 mg/kg) appears to be effective and may be preferred over the approved dose. The honey ﬂavored oral liquid marketed for dogs is widely used (off label) in cats because it is palatable and has been used for longer periods. Ketoprofen is available as an injectable formulation but oral preparations are commonly compounded. The pharmacokinetics and clinical efﬁcacy of ketoprofen are well documented.55,101,104 and it has been used for up to 5 days to treat cats with musculoskeletal pain105 Be- cause it is a potent COX-1 inhibitor, it may interfere with platelet function. There seems to be little difference in the efﬁcacy of the NSAIDs described above for the treatment of acute surgical pain.101,102 Comparison of injectable NSAIDs given subcutaneously at extubation following ovario- hysterectomy (carprofen 4 mg/kg, ketoprofen 2 mg/kg, and meloxicam 0.2 mg/kg), resulted in 9 out of 10 cats in
each group having desirable overall clinical assess- ment scores for 18 hours. Despite the cats’ apparent comfort, none of the NSAIDs prevented postoperative wound tenderness.101 If used as part of an analgesic plan, the choice of agent will depend on personal pref- erence, and intended duration of use. Effects of analgesics on gastrointestinal function The effects of pain itself and the analgesics and seda- tives used in the critical care setting on bowel function must be considered. Pain can cause bowel stasis, ab- dominal distension, discomfort, and vomiting adding to the overall misery of the patient. Analgesic inter- vention often results in a dramatic improvement but if therapy is continued for days or weeks the effects on gastrointestinal function should be monitored. IM acepromazine (0.1 mg/kg) combined with bupre- norphine (0.01 mg/kg) or medetomidine (50 mg/kg) alone provided good restraint and did not alter oro- caecal transit time in cats, whereas ketamine (5 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) did decrease gastrointesti- nal motility.106 The use of TDF patches has not sparked comments about constipation and transdermal bupre- & Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2005, doi: 10.1111/j.1476-4431.2005.00172.x 268 S.A. Robertson norphine patches did not affect food intake or frequen- cy of bowel movements.60 However, systemic treatment with buprenorphine can cause inappetence in some cats after 2–3 days, which often resolves when the dose is reduced (author’s own observations), or if there are no contraindications, NSAID therapy can begin and opioid doses decreased or stopped. In humans, immobility contributes to constipation and this no doubt also applies to animals; although it may be difﬁcult to encourage a cat to exercise, it should be given room to move around and the chance to in- teract with humans and toys while hospitalized. Opioid antagonists that work only at peripheral sites and do not
antagonize centrally mediated analgesia show great promise in humans107 for treating ileus but have not been used widely in veterinary medicine. Special Situations Management of fractious patients Fractious cats are a challenge in the emergency setting because the clinician is unable to examine the patient and may have no history or access to previous blood work. It is often unclear if the cat is painful or not. However, physical restraint is often ineffective and can lead to further stress and even worsening of wounds or fractures if the cat continues to resist and becomes ex- plosive. Clinicians often resort to placing these cats in an anesthetic chamber and administering inhalant agent. Great care should be taken as endogenous cat- echolamines combined with a high concentration of in- halant agent can be a lethal combination. Isoﬂurane and sevoﬂurane do not sensitize the heart to catecholamines as much as halothane and these newer agents may re- duce the incidence of complications. Alternative techniques include oral (transmucosal) drug administration. If the cat is injured and, therefore, painful, OTM buprenorphine (0.02–0.03 mg/kg) may be sufﬁcient to sedate the cat. Oral xylazine, detomidine, or medetomidine combined with ketamine can provide useful sedation108,109 as can ketamine alone.109 Head trauma In several situations such as high-rise syndrome or hit- by-car scenarios, cats have multiple injuries and require analgesic intervention and or anesthesia, but may also have head trauma. In these situations, opioids are the ﬁrst drug of choice as respiratory depression (which would include hypercapnia and cerebral vasodilation) is unusual at clinical doses. Medetomidine causes un- predictable vomiting and increased intracranial pres- sure (ICP) and should be avoided. The use of ketamine in the face of head trauma is controversial but it appears that ketamine may in fact be neuroprotective.110 In a space-occupying model of brain edema
in cats, ketamine (2 mg/kg IV) decreased ICP and improved cerebral perfusion pressure and in a cytotoxic model ketamine had no effect on ICP.111 In summary, there is now considerable feline-specific analgesic data available and this can be incorporated into clinical practice. Opioids should be the ﬁrst choice of drug, with buprenorphine a top choice because of its efﬁcacy and lack of side effects. Local anesthetic tech- niques are under-utilized and time spent learning spe- cific blocks will be time well spent. With care, the a2- agonists and NSAIDs can also be used. Ketamine may have a role to play in overall pain management but still requires further study in cats.

E-mail: ktobias@utk.edu Abstract Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of preopera- tive administration of oral carprofen, subcutaneous ketoprofen, and local nerve block with bupivacaine in preventing postoperative pain-associated behav- ior in cats after ovariohysterectomy. Animals Fifty-two female intact cats. Materials and methods Cats received butorphanol (0.44 mg kg)1 IM), carprofen (2.2 mg kg)1 PO), ketoprofen (2.2 mg kg)1 SQ), or bupivacaine inﬁl- tration block (1.1 mg kg)1 SQ) before surgery. Cortisol and drug concentrations and visual analog scale (VAS) and interactive visual analog scale (IVAS) pain-associated behavior scores were meas- ured
2 hours before and 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after ovariohysterectomy. Results Cats receiving butorphanol had signiﬁcantly increased IVAS scores 2 hours after surgery com- pared with baseline measurements. Cats receiving carprofen, ketoprofen, and bupivacaine had signiﬁ- cant increases from baseline in VAS and IVAS scores 1 and 2 hours after surgery. VAS and IVAS scores for cats receiving bupivacaine were signiﬁcantly greater 1 and 2 hours after surgery than for cats that received butorphanol. Cats receiving carprofen had signiﬁcant increases in cortisol 1 hour after surgery and signiﬁcant decreases 24 hours after surgery compared with baseline measurements. Conclusions and clinical relevance Preoperative carprofen and ketoprofen have effects on pain- associated behavior similar to butorphanol in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Cats receiving bupivacaine blocks may require additional analge- sics immediately after surgery. Keywords analgesia, bupivacaine, butorphanol, car- profen, cats, ketoprofen. Introduction Most veterinarians agree that ovariohysterectomy causes postoperative pain in cats (Lascelles et al. 1999). Practitioners are often reluctant to admin- ister perioperative analgesics, however, because of lack of familiarity with available drugs, concerns about side effects, or frustration with the need for record keeping of controlled substances (Lascelles et al. 1999; Wright 2002). The ideal analgesic would be inexpensive, easy to administer, readily available, long-lasting, and effective. It should have few side effects; and would require no special licensing or storage. Besides opioids and alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonists, options for controlling perioperative pain in cats include oral and injectable nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ketoprofen (Ketofen; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA, USA) and carprofen (Rimadyl; Pﬁzer Animal Health, Exton, PA, USA), and local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine (Bupi- vacaine HCl; Abbott Labs, North Chicago, IL, USA) 390 Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia, 2006, 33, 390–398 doi:10.1111/j.1467-2995.2005.00282.x (Hellyer & Gaynor 1998; Lamont 2002). The use of
these drugs is attractive because they meet many of the above criteria. Administration of systemic or local analgesics before surgery may reduce an animal’s need for postoperative pain intervention. Stimulation of per- ipheral nociceptors with surgical trauma can induce peripheral hypersensitivity and upregulation of cen- tral neuronal activity, resulting in a prolonged and intensiﬁed pain response with further stimulation of the site (Lascelles et al. 1998; Lamont 2002). Once neural pathways are sensitized, the physiologic and behavioral responses to pain may persist, even when the nerves themselves are blocked or transected (Lascelles et al. 1998). Pre-emptive analgesic administration prevents this central sensitization, thus effectively limiting pain perception. Reports of the effectiveness of pre-emptive analgesia in cats are limited (Lascelles et al. 1997; Cambridge et al. 2000; Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 2002). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of preoperative administration of oral carprofen, subcutaneous ketoprofen, and re- gional inﬁltration block with bupivacaine in pre- venting pain in cats after ovariohysterectomy. We hypothesized that each of these drugs would reduce pain-associated behavior scores comparable to that of cats treated preoperatively with butorphanol. Materials and methods Fifty-two healthy (ASA1) female cats weighing >2.2 kg were included in the study, with 13 cats in each group. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and permission was obtained from the cats’ caregivers before participation. Age of most cats was unknown, although all were suspected to be at least 6 months of age; two cats were at least 5 years old. Health status of the cats was evaluated by physical examination and measurement of preoperative packed cell volume (PCV) and total protein (TP) in all cats and additionally by evaluation of complete blood counts and biochemistry panels in the two older cats. Cats were randomly assigned
to receive one of the following analgesics: carprofen (2.2 mg kg)1 PO) 2 hours before sedation; keto- profen (2.2 mg kg)1 SQ) after sedation; butorpha- nol tartrate [Torbugesic; Fort Dodge Animal Health (0.44 mg kg)1 IM)] after sedation; or 0.5% bupi- vacaine inﬁltration block of the surgical site (1.1 mg kg)1 SQ) after anesthesia. Two milliliters of blood was obtained for meas- urement of baseline plasma cortisol and drug concentrations 2–3 hours before sedation and before administration of any drugs. Baseline (preoperative) visual analog scale (VAS) and interactive visual analog scale (IVAS) scores were recorded immediately before venipuncture. Forty-ﬁve minutes before surgery, cats were sedated with acepromazine [acepromazine maleate; Boeh- ringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc., St Joseph, MO, USA (0.022 mg kg)1 IM)] and ketamine hydrochlo- ride [Ketaset; Fort Dodge Animal Health (4.4 mg kg)1 IM)]. Anesthesia was induced with isoﬂurane in oxygen, delivered by mask, and main- tained after tracheal intubation with isoﬂurane in oxygen. A jugular vein was catheterized with a 20–22 SWG, through the needle, 13 cm Teﬂon catheter to permit postoperative blood sampling. As described by Smith et al. (1996), lactated Ringers solution (16.5 mL kg)1 hour)1 for 2 hours) was administered via the jugular catheter, beginning after catheter placement, to provide volume replacement and cardiovascular support. For cats in the bupivicaine group, bupivicaine was admin- istered subcutaneously over a 2.5-cm distance along the midline midway between the umbilicus and pubis. All cats underwent routine midline ovariohysterectomy through a 2-cm incision by the same surgeon (KMT). Cats were placed in recovery cages in a feline ward for postoperative observation by a trained observer who was unaware of the preoperative treatment protocol. Visual analog scale and IVAS scores were recorded and then blood samples obtained at 0 (extubation), 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after surgery.
Additionally, the observer made note of cats that subjectively had poor recoveries (i.e. violent, thrashing motions or biting handlers) the ﬁrst 15 minutes after extubation. For VAS and IVAS scores, the observer marked the estimated degree of pain on a 100-mm line, with 0 being no pain, and 100 mm being the worst imaginable pain. Visual analog scale scores were based on observations of the cat’s resting behavior. Cats that approached the cage door, arched their backs for attention, or stretched out in a relaxed position and actively groomed were considered to have VAS pain scores of 0; VAS scores of 100 would be given if cats were recumbent and open-mouth breathing or lost consciousness after anesthetic recovery. The IVAS score was recorded after opening the cage door, talking to the cat, petting Evaluation of four analgesic protocols in cats KM Tobias et al.  2006 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 33, 390–398 391 its head, and palpating its abdomen. Cats that did not object to or avoid abdominal palpation and had no ﬂinching of skin or muscle with palpations were considered to have IVAS scores of 0. Agitated vocalization and biting during palpation or uncon- sciousness after anesthetic recovery were to be given IVAS scores of 100. The jugular catheter was then aspirated and 1 mL of blood was removed temporarily. An addi- tional 2 mL blood sample was aspirated and placed in a heparinized tube, and the initial 1 mL of blood was re-infused. The catheter was then ﬂushed with 1 mL of heparinized saline. The blood sample was centrifuged, the plasma extracted and stored at )20 C until blood samples from all cats were available for measurement of cortisol and plasma drug concentrations. Plasma cortisol concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay, and concen- trations of the drugs were measured
with high performance liquid chromatography using modiﬁ- cations of methods previously published (Furst et al. 1988; Willey et al. 1994; DeGraves et al. 1996; Tahraoui et al. 1996). Cats with VAS scores greater than 30 mm or IVAS scores of 50 mm or greater during postoper- ative monitoring received rescue analgesia (but- orphanol, 0.4 mg kg)1 IM) as needed. Data collected after rescue analgesic administration were not included in the statistical analysis. At the completion of the study, jugular catheters were removed and the cats were returned to their caregivers. The effects of treatment, time, and treatment by time interaction on cortisol level and VAS and IVAS pain scores in ovariohysterectomized cats were evaluated using a mixed model analysis of variance procedure (Proc Mixed, SAS version 9.0; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Cat was included in the model as a random factor. Time as a repeated measure was evaluated and removed from the model based on the )2 log-likelihood statistic, which indicated that there was no improvement in ﬁt of the model to the data. Values for cortisol were transformed using the log base 10 in order to approximate a normal distri- bution. VAS and IVAS analog scores were trans- formed using the rank procedure due to zeroes in the data (Proc Rank, SAS version 8.0; SAS Institute Inc.). Signiﬁcant differences in least square means among the various levels of treat- ment, time, and treatment by time were adjusted using the method of Bonferroni. Descriptive data are reported as the mean ± 1 standard deviation, with signiﬁcance set at p £ 0.05. Results Of the 52 cats included in the study, two cats (one from the butorphanol group and one from the car- profen group) were excluded after surgery because of anemia secondary to accidental overdose of IV ﬂuids
(up to 66 mL kg)1 total dose over a 2-hour period). A third cat was given ketoprofen instead of bupivacaine. Therefore, 14 cats received ketoprofen; the remaining groups each contained 12 cats. Mean surgery time was 12.1 ± 3.9 minutes (median, 10 minutes) and mean anesthesia time was 30.0 ± 19.2 minutes. Ten cats had poor recoveries, including six cats that received ketoprofen, three cats that received bupivacaine, and one cat that received carprofen. Rescue analgesia was adminis- tered 2 hours after surgery in one cat that received a bupivacaine infusion block and 1 hour after sur- gery in one cat that received ketoprofen. One cat from the ketoprofen group died 7 hours after sur- gery; results from this cat were not included in the VAS, IVAS, or cortisol data analyses. All cats had VAS and IVAS scores of 0 before surgery (baseline) and at extubation (time 0). Cats which received butorphanol had no signiﬁcant changes in VAS scores compared with baseline but had signiﬁcant increases in IVAS scores 2 hours after surgery (Figs 1 & 2; p ¼ 0.0231). Cats receiv- ing carprofen, ketoprofen, and bupivacaine had signiﬁcant increases from baseline in VAS and IVAS scores 1 and 2 hours after surgery (Figs 1 & 2; p £ 0.0122). In all cats, VAS and IVAS scores were not signiﬁcantly different from baseline 4–24 hours after surgery. There were no signiﬁcant differences in VAS and IVAS scores at any time when comparing cats that received butorphanol, carprofen, or ketoprofen (Figs 1 & 2). Visual analog scale and IVAS scores for cats receiving bupivacaine were signiﬁcantly greater 1 hour after surgery compared with cats that received butorphanol (p ¼ 0.002 and p ¼ 0.029, respectively). Cortisol and peak postoperative plasma drug concentrations were available for nine cats that received butorphanol, eight
cats that received car- profen, 10 cats that received ketoprofen, and 10 cats that received bupivacaine. Results were not available for 10 cats because of difﬁculties with sample procurement (i.e., jugular catheter failure) Evaluation of four analgesic protocols in cats KM Tobias et al. 392  2006 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 33, 390–398 or plasma analysis. Signiﬁcant differences in plasma cortisol concentrations were only seen in cats receiving carprofen (Fig. 3). Plasma cortisol con- centrations of cats receiving carprofen were signi- ﬁcantly higher 1 hour after surgery compared with concentrations measured before surgery and 2, 8, 12, and 24 hours after surgery (p £ 0.029). Cort- isol concentrations 24 hours after surgery were signiﬁcantly lower than concentrations measured before surgery and at 0, 1, and 4 hours after surgery (p £ 0.0033). At 24 hours after surgery, cortisol concentrations of cats receiving carprofen were signiﬁcantly lower than those of cats receiving butorphanol (p ¼ 0.039). Cortisol concentrations at other time periods were not signiﬁcantly different among or between groups. Peak postoperative plasma concentrations of cats receiving butorphanol occurred at 0 hours for seven cats and 1 hour for two cats. Butorphanol was detectable in the plasma of all nine cats 8 hours after surgery (Fig. 4). Peak plasma concentrations of cats receiving bupivacaine occurred at 0 hours for four cats, 1 hour for three cats, and 4 hours for one cat. Two cats had no detectable drug at any time period. Seven of nine cats had detectable bupivacaine concentrations 8 hours after surgery (Fig. 5). Because plasma concentrations of butor- phanol and bupivacaine were extremely low at 8 hours, plasma samples taken 12 or more hours after surgery from these cats were not analyzed. Of the cats receiving carprofen, peak postoperative plasma concentrations occurred at 0 hours for one cat,
1 hour for three cats, 4 hours for one cat, 8 hours for two cats, and 24 hours for one cat. Carprofen was still measurable in the plasma in seven of seven cats 24 hours after surgery (Fig. 6). Peak postoperative plasma concentration occurred at 0 hours for all cats that received ketoprofen. No drug was detectable in 1/10 cats at 4 hours and in 3/9 cats at 8 hours (Fig. 7). Four of ten cats had detectable concentrations of ketoprofen in plasma 24 hours after surgery. Complications were seen in a 4-kg, 8-year-old Maine coon cat that received ketoprofen before surgery. Preoperative complete blood count (CBC) and biochemical proﬁle were normal, except for increased total protein (9.2 g dL)1; reference range, 5.6–7.1 g dL)1) and decreased albumin (2.6 g dL)1; reference range, 2.7–6.5 g dL)1). Four hours after surgery, the cat became lethargic, tachypneic, and pale. Biochemistry proﬁle and PCV/TP were repeated; abnormalities included hypoproteinemia (5.3 g dL)1; reference range, 5.6–7.1 g dL)1), hypoalbuminemia (1.5 g dL)1; ref- erence range 2.7–6.5 g dL)1), hypochloridemia (3.0 mEq L)1; reference range, 3.3–5.3 mEq L)1), hypocalcemia (7.7 mg dL)1; reference range, 8.2– 11.5 mg dL)1), hypocholesterolemia (57 mg dL)1; reference range, 73–265 mg dL)1), and hyper- glycemia (304 mg dL)1; reference range, 63– 140 mg dL)1). Postoperative liver enzymes, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine concentrations were within normal limits.

Post-mortem ﬁndings included pul- monary edema, unilateral chronic interstitial neph- ritis with estimated loss of 50% of renal tissue, and acute suppurative portal hepatitis and cholangitis consistent with ascending biliary infection or portal seeding. None of the post-mortem ﬁndings were consistent with acute drug toxicity. Discussion In this study, signiﬁcant increases from baseline in VAS and IVAS scores were seen within 1 or 2 hours after surgery. However, scores four or more hours after surgery were not signiﬁcantly different from baseline for any group. The average surgery time in this study (12 minutes) was relatively short com- pared with previous studies, in which surgery dur- ation ranged from 27 to 60 minutes (Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 1998, 2000; Smith et al. 1999; Ansah et al. 2002). Additionally, ovariohysterecto- my was performed by ﬁnal year veterinary students in most previous studies (Lascelles et al. 1995; Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 1998, 2000; Smith et al. 1999; Ansah et al. 2002). Cats in our study probably suffered less tissue trauma because of the short surgery time and experience of the surgeon, and postoperative recoveries would more likely be consistent with those seen in the average small animal practice. Because objective parameters such as heart rate, respiration rate, temperature, and cortisol concen- trations have not consistently been correlated with postoperative pain in cats, need for postoperative analgesia is often based on behavioral indicators (Smith et al. 1996, 1999; Cambridge et al. 2000). Behavioral changes associated with pain in cats, however, can be very subtle. Some cats may vocalize or thrash about, but more often cats that are in pain will rest quietly in the corner of the cage or hide from observers. Some cats will take a hunched or curled position, reacting only when the affected area is manipulated (Hellyer & Gaynor 1998; Wright 2002). Because
cats may also with- draw in stressful or uncomfortable environments, pain-associated behavior changes in this species are harder to quantify with descriptive scales. Visual analog scale and IVAS scores have been shown to correlate with postoperative pain in cats, and most evaluators will include interaction with the animal and manipulation of the surgical site (IVAS) to increase the sensitivity of the scoring system (Las- celles et al. 1995; Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 1998; Cambridge et al. 2000). In our study, cats were to be assigned IVAS scores of 100 mm if they lost consciousness after anesthetic recovery. Be- cause of this deﬁnition, IVAS scores were 0 imme- diately after extubation because the cats showed no reaction to abdominal palpation, presumably as they were still under the effects of the anesthetic agents. Low dosages of ketamine and acepromazine were used in our study to provide sedation and immobil- ization prior to surgery. In cats, acepromazine (0.05 mg kg)1 IV) administered simultaneously with a combination of oxymorphone and butor- phanol (0.05 mg kg)1 IV each) increased the mag- nitude of antinociceptive effects of the opioids 15 minutes after administration, but did not provide signiﬁcantly greater threshold responses 30 or more minutes after administration of the drugs (Briggs et al. 1998). Potentiation of antinociceptive pro- perties of NSAIDs and inﬁltration blocks by ace- promazine in the cat have not been reported. The effectiveness of ketamine as an analgesic is cur- rently under debate. In humans undergoing limb amputation (Hayes et al. 2004) or tonsillectomy (Van Elstraete et al. 2004), ketamine given as an IV bolus at induction and continued as a low-dose constant rate infusion did not signiﬁcantly reduce acute central sensitization, incidence and severity of postoperative pain, or analgesic requirements after surgery. In another study, ketamine constant rate infusion increased mechanical pain threshold
and reduced windup-like pain in humans that received morphine prior to experimentally induced burns (Schulte et al. 2004). Constant rate infusion of ketamine in dogs during and after surgery, when combined with fentanyl infusions, reduced post- operative pain behavior-associated scores in dogs undergoing forelimb amputation (Wagner et al. 2002). In cats, intravenous ketamine (2 mg kg)1) increased thermal threshold 15 and 30 minutes after administration (Robertson et al. 2003). Ther- mal threshold returned to baseline at 60 minutes but was signiﬁcantly decreased below baseline between 210 and 390 minutes after administration, suggesting that ketamine might cause a delayed- onset hyperalgesia. Because duration of analgesia provided by a single dose of ketamine has been reported to be relatively short and systemic avail- ability is less when it is given by the intra- Evaluation of four analgesic protocols in cats KM Tobias et al.  2006 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 33, 390–398 395 muscular route than after intravenous administra- tion (Heavner & Bloedow 1979; Hanna et al. 1988; Sawyer et al. 1993), we are unsure that preopera- tive ketamine provided any signiﬁcant analgesic effects for the cats one or more hours after surgery in our study. As described by Smith et al. (1996), lactated Ringer’s solution (33 mL kg)1) was administered during anesthesia and recovery to provide volume replacement and cardiovascular support. It is not known whether this dose of crystalloid ﬂuid had any dilutional effect on plasma drug and cortisol con- centrations. In two cats, ﬂuid rates were miscalcu- lated, resulting in signiﬁcant hemodilution. These cats were removed from the study. Cats that received butorphanol had no signiﬁ- cant change in VAS scores, but did have increased IVAS scores 2 hours after surgery. It is possible that the combination of acepromazine/ ketamine HCl premedication with preoperative IM butorphanol provided sedation that
masked visual behavior changes 2 hours after surgery, as pain- associated behavior was notable only after palpa- tion of the incision site. Butorphanol has agonist activity at the j receptors, which are responsible for analgesia and sedation, and at the r receptors, which are responsible for autonomic stimulation and dysphoria (Hosgood 1990). Sedative effects of butorphanol alone are variable, but are increased when combined with other drugs (Tranquilli et al. 1988; Hosgood 1990). Visual and interactive pain scores were signiﬁ- cantly increased 1 and 2 hours after surgery compared with baseline in cats that received keto- profen, carprofen, and bupivacaine, although VAS and IVAS scores of cats that received ketoprofen and carprofen were not signiﬁcantly different from those of cats that received butorphanol. Bupivacaine injected perineurally can provide pain relief for 2– 6 hours (Lemke & Dawson 2000; Lamont 2002). In this study, bupivacaine may have provided less analgesia compared with butorphanol because of its lack of systemic effects. Additionally, bupivacaine’s onset of action is 20–30 minutes (Lemke & Dawson 2000); thus, surgical stimulation of nociceptors may have occurred prior to onset of drug effects. Despite signiﬁcant increases in bupivacaine VAS and IVAS scores, rescue analgesics were only required in one cat in our study. Use of bupivacaine inﬁltration at the incision site before surgery did not signiﬁcantly lower postoperative pain scores in dogs undergoing laparotomy, but did decrease the fre- quency of postoperative analgesic administration (Savvas et al. 2003). In cats that received carprofen, cortisol concen- trations were signiﬁcantly increased 1 hour after surgery. Cats in our study may have experienced an early increase in cortisol because of slow absorption or delayed onset of action of oral carprofen. Stress, anorexia, and pain may reduce gastric emptying time, intestinal motility, and portal blood ﬂow, reducing or slowing drug absorption (Jamali
& Kunz-Dober 1999; Whittem et al. 2000). In our study, plasma concentrations peaked at a mean time of 5.9 hours after surgery (approximately 8.9 hours after oral administration). Although onset of action of carprofen after oral administration has not been reported in cats, delayed onset of action has been noted after subcutaneous adminis- tration in this species (Lascelles et al. 1995; Taylor et al. 1996). Cats that received carprofen in our study experienced a prolonged effect, as demonstra- ted by signiﬁcant reduction in 24 hour plasma cortisol concentrations compared with those measured before surgery. Elimination half-life of carprofen is 9 hours when administered orally and 19–20 hours when given IV or subcutaneously (Taylor et al. 1996; Parton et al. 2000). Because the pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic relation- ship of NSAIDs is complex, peak plasma concentra- tion may not be a reliable guide for dosing strategies (Lascelles et al. 1998). Additionally, long duration of action and huge variability in elimination rates in cats make multiple dosing of carprofen difﬁcult (Parton et al. 2000). Pain scores from cats receiving ketoprofen were not signiﬁcantly different from those receiving carprofen or butorphanol, although cats in the ketoprofen group tended to have rough recoveries compared with other cats. In previous studies, ketoprofen provided analgesia similar to that of carprofen, meloxicam, tolfenamic acid, and bupre- norphine, and better than pethidine, when admin- istered after ovariohysterectomy in cats (Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 1998, 2000). Ketoprofen is not usually administered before surgery because of concerns about its effects on renal perfusion and platelet function. Ketoprofen inhibits both cyclo- oxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase and has a direct inhibitory effect on bradykinin (Isaacs 1996). Inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis through COX 1 inhibition may result in decreased renal blood ﬂow and glomerular ﬁltration rate (Isaacs 1996). Ketoprofen has good gastrointestinal and Evaluation of four
analgesic protocols in cats KM Tobias et al. 396  2006 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 33, 390–398 renal safety in well-hydrated patients that have stable cardiovascular function (Maddison 2002). In our study we chose to use ketoprofen preopera- tively, as ﬂuid supplementation would be initiated before, and continued after, the surgical procedure. Risk of toxicity may increase with pre-existing renal disease or hypotension secondary to anesthesia or blood loss (Isaacs 1996; Maddison 2002). One cat that received ketoprofen died 7 hours after surgery, and renal dysfunction may have played a role in its demise. Chronic renal disease in that cat was not evident on preoperative blood chemistry, although the cat had hyperglobulinemia consistent with neoplasia or chronic inﬂammation (Dimski 1997). Loss of more than 75% of renal function is required before changes in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine are seen in cats with primary renal disease (Dibartola 2000). Signs of NSAID toxicity such as gastrointestinal erosions or inﬂammation and renal papillary necrosis (Isaacs 1996; Pages et al. 1996), were not noted on post- mortem examination. However, these changes may not have occurred rapidly enough to have been observed at the time of this cat’s death. It is interesting to note that the cat’s liver enzymes and renal blood parameters were normal after surgery, despite the pathology present in those organs. As ketoprofen is highly protein bound (Lees et al. 2003), hypoalbuminemia in this cat may have resulted in a relative overdose of the drug, poten- tially contributing to the cat’s death. Because this was a clinical study with client- owned animals, we chose not to have positive and negative controls (animals undergoing surgery without additional analgesics, and animals receiv- ing analgesics without surgery). Additionally, if a nonsurgical group had been included, abdominal bandages would have been required on all cats
to hide surgical incisions from the blinded observer. This could have affected the observer’s ability to palpate the incision site and may have changed the cats’ postoperative behaviors. In conclusion, preoperative oral carprofen and subcutaneous ketoprofen produced similar altera- tions in pain-associated behavior when compared with preoperative intramuscular butorphanol in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Because of variable and possibly prolonged gastrointestinal absorption of carprofen, administration of the drug more than 2 hours before surgery may be necessary. Cats receiving bupivacaine blocks may require additional analgesics for the ﬁrst 4 hours after surgery. While preoperative ketoprofen caused no apparent adverse effects in young, healthy, well-hydrated cats, it should be used before surgery with caution because of potential adverse effects.

Wright, DVM, DACVA Although pain management is an emerging and popular topic in veterinary medicine, use of analgesics in cats has received little attention relative to their canine counterparts. Some of the diffi- culty lies in assessment of whether or not a cat is in pain. Simple observation of a cat in a cage relies upon overt expression of pain, and is often inaccurate. Pain scales have been developed that allow a semiquantitative evaluation of the degree of pain an animal may be experiencing. However, treating pain based upon observation of the painful state is less effective than anticipating and preemptively treating pain. This article reviews specific methods for preemptively treating and alleviating pain in the cat. The traditional approach to pain management involves drug administration. Specific categories of agents used in cats include opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, or alpha-2 agonists. Other modatities of pain management, which are also reviewed, include use of local anesthetic drugs for local and regional analgesia, as well as acupuncture. Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA).

As the awareness for pain management in- creases, so does the evidence-based research being conducted to validate treatment modalities. Nevertheless, a
significant portion of veterinary analgesia remains experiential. This is especially true for the feline species. This article will present both the evidence-based information available and the clinical experience of professionals who have spent a tremendous amount of time practicing the art of pain alleviation. In a variety of studies, cats have received relatively less anal- gesic coverage than their canine counterparts.~,a The authors of these studies suggest several possible reasons for this disparity. There is a dearth of scientific evidence behind the practice of feline analgesia. This lack of scientific support for choosing particular analgesic drugs is further complicated by the chal- lenge of finding a safe drug for cats. Because cats have reduced ability to metabolize drugs via hepatic gtucuronidation, plasma drug concentrations are often prolonged. Cats are susceptible to toxicity from many drugs, including the popular .analgesic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Opioids are known to cause dose-dependent excitement or dysphoria in cats, which although avoidable with low doses, causes a great deal of concern for many practitioners} -3 Last, feline social From the Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Med- icine and Biomedical Sciences, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado.

In the wild, a painful or injured animal will commonly be attacked by the other animals. 4 Therefore, a cat's expression of pain is often subtle to nonexistent. Unless specific attention is given to assessing a cat's analgesic state, pain is easily over- looked. Untreated pain generates
physiological damage (Table 1). Subjecting animals recovering from disease or surgical inter- vention to these increased metabolic demands may further compromise their medical condition. Therefore, a modality to anticipate and treat pain is imperative to the most general prac- tice of veterinary medicine. Assessment of Pain Diagnosis of pain can be either presumptive or observational. Cats tend to hide when they are sick or in pain and it isunusual for a cat to vocalize when in pain. 5-7 A painful cat may be hunched, less responsive to external stimulus, and may guard the painful area. 5,6 Simple observation of an animal in a cage, however, relies upon overt expression of pain and is often inaccurate. In an attempt to improve pain diagnosis, work has been done to evaluate pain scales for use in domestic animals. 5-8 Pain scales allow a semiquantitative evaluation of the degree of pain an individual may be experiencing, and usually take into account both physiologic signs--such as increased heart rate and respiratory rate--as well as the animal's response to stim- ulus and manipulation. 8 Although pain scales improve the sen- sitivity of pain diagnosis, nonverbal animals require an ob- server for pain rating, and stoically painful animals may still be missed. Postoperative pain can be very difficult to diagnose because of the blurring of physiologic signs of pain with other physio- logic changes. Studies show that heart rate and respiratory rate may not be different between operated-on and unoperated-on cats after anesthesia, r,a This is expected because many other physiologic changes can alter heart rate and respiratory rate, as can many pharmacologic manipulations, making these very nonspecific, inaccurate indices of pain. For instance, both stress from the hospital experience and pain tend to cause hyperventilation. Simultaneously, pain and splinting after tho- racic surgery may greatly reduce
ventilation, as does broncho- constriction generated by the increased sympathetic tone of the stress response. Ultimately, the most accurate diagnostic indi- cator of pain may be responses to therapy, such as a more interactive patient or a patient that becomes able to sleep com- fortably. Although pain scales may be the most effective way for an observer to diagnose pain in a cat, by the time this assess- ment has been made, the animal is already in pain. 5-s Treating pain before initiation of the painful stimulus prevents central sensitization to pain, and is the cornerstone of modern pain medicine. 5-9 For these reasons, having a template for presump- tive diagnosis of pain before initiation is important. 2002: pp 151-157 151 TABLE 1.

This is an incomplete list of the results of pain upon the physiologic state. For presumptive diagnosis of a painful state, analogies with other species may be helpful. Nociceptive physiology is well preserved between species,
justifying this extrapolation. 1~ If a procedure elicits a predictable amount of pain in people, dogs, or other species studied, it likely does the same in cats. Pre- sumptive diagnosis promotes analgesic administration before the painful stimulus, maximizing the preemptive facilitation of analgesia. Treating pain based upon observation of the painful state is therefore less effective than anticipating and preemp- tively treating pain. Anticipated levels of pain for illness and injury have been formulated (Table 2). These are presumptive only, and may be affected by severity, additional inflammation or infection, indi- vidual pain threshold, surgical technique, and concomitant sources of pain (e.g., osteoarthritis). Young animals tend to be less pain-tolerant and more demonstrative of pain, whereas geriatric animals will often hide their pain. s~ Treatment stan- dards established for the presumptive level of pain for a given procedure facilitate a multimodal approach to analgesia. If ap- propriate analgesics for the anticipated level of pain are insuf- ficient for an individual, further analgesic therapy can be initi- ated. It is important to note that even relatively noninvasive procedures are likely to cause some degree of pain, and many preexisting diseases are extremely painful. These sources of pain need to be considered in addition to the analgesic tech- niques established for surgical patients.

Drugs that com- petitively bind
to opioid receptors can do one of three things: completely activate the receptor (agonists), causing full expres- sion of receptor function; partially bind to the receptor, causing partial expression of the receptors function (or partially block- ing the receptor if it is already functional); or fully antagonize the receptor, completely eliminating the function of the recep- tor during the duration of action of the drug. Agonists and partial agonists are useful to produce varying degrees of anal- gesia. Opioids do not modulate nerve conduction, but inhibit release of excitatory neurotransmitters at the level of the brain and spinal cord. Consequently, opioids reduce the pain from a stimulus, but do not obliterate the stimulus or interfere with motor function. Common opioid side effects are bradycardia, sedation, urinary retention, respiratory depression, gastrointes- tinal (GI) stasis, vomiting and nausea (less common postoper- atively or in painful patients), and occasional dysphoria or excitement. Opioids have minimal effects on cardiac function (aside from the effects of histamine release with morphine and meperidine), and are considered safe in compromised patients and animals with heart conditions. 1 There are three currently recognized opiold receptors,/,, 8, and •. All three receptors mediate analgesia although the qual- ity of analgesia varies, as does the severity of side.effects. In general,/* and K receptors are the primary target in veterinary practice with the drugs currently available./x receptor agonists provide more profound analgesia in many species, although this is controversial in cats./, agonists are generally accompa- nied by more pronounced side effects than K agonists (Table 3). In studies examining the analgesic usage in veterinary med- icine, a reluctance of practitioners to use potent opioids in cats is apparent. Concern about drug side effects, as well as the need for record keeping for use of these controlled substances are cited as reasons
for this disparity, z,2 Although an occasional cat may become dysphoric on opioids, it is uncommon at effica- cious doses, and not limited to cats. 3 Dysphoria can often be avoided by staying within the recommended dose range (cats have a lower dose range than dogs), and can also be greatly reduced by concurrent use of a tranquilizer. 3,5-9 When an indi- vidual exhibits dysphoria, adjunctive analgesic techniques such as c~-2 agonists can ameliorate the excitement while providing necessary analgesia. Respiratory depression from opioids is a significant problem in human medicine, but far less pro- nounced in domestic animals at clinical doses. 1~ Finally, the legal records required for opioid use are no longer restricted to opioids, and include many other commonly used anesthetic drugs. Emerging concepts in feline analgesia with opioids include the use of transmucosal buprenorphine, which has been shown to have remarkably predictable, rapid, and effective uptake when sprayed onto the mucous membranes, facilitating home administration.12 Current clinical impression is that hydromor- CLINICAL PAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES FOR CATS 153 TABLE 4.

Fentanyl patches have contributed to longer duration of analgesia, but must be monitored closely because of extreme variability in individual uptake and efficacy in cats. 13-15 Additional applications for opioids include local and re- gional techniques. Opioid receptors have been isolated on no- ciceptive nerve terminals in inflamed synovial tissue, although work has not been done to verify their presence in cats. 16 Intra- articular administration of opioids may be beneficial, especially when combined with a local anesthetic. A dose of 0.1 mg/kg morphine diluted to the appropriate volume for the joint being explored with saline or local anesthetics is recommended. 17 Additionally, epidural or intrathecal administration of opioids has been described as excellent anesthesia adjuncts. 18 The tech- nique for epidurals has been well described in a number of texts.17-= With the addition of local anesthetics there is further potentiation of analgesia with a loss or reduction of motor function. Low-dose local anesthetics preferentially block sen- sory fibers in the spinal cord and may have minimal effect on motor function. 1<19 c~-2 agonists administered added to epi- dural morphine dramatically augment analgesia via synergistic action of c~-2 and opioid receptors in the spine. For long-term pain relief, placement of an epidural catheter can facilitate re- peat injections or constant epidural infusion of analgesic drugs. 18,19,22 Summary 9 Opioids are efficacious analgesics in cats 9 Opioids rarely cause excitement at clinical doses in cats 9 Systemic and regional use of opioids are possible 9 OpioMs and opioid combinations are ideal for epidural ad- ministration NSAIDs NSAIDs provide analgesia peripherally by reducing inflamma- tion, decreasing release of substances involved in pain recogni- tion and, in some
cases (carprofen), centrally by reducing pain perception and reducing central hypersensitivity. 23 NSAIDs provide a cornerstone of pain management in people and act synergistically with opioids. However, dogs and cats are far more susceptible to toxicity from these drugs, so they must be used with cautionY NSAIDs function through inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (COX), reducing the production of prosta- glandins. Two forms of COX have been isolated, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is associated with normal metabolic function (constitutive), balancing blood flow to organs such as the GI tract, kidney, and liver. COX-2 appears to be produced in re- sponse to tissue injury (inducible). For safety and analgesic efficacy, drugs that preferentially block the COX-2 receptor are preferred. These drugs include meloxicam, carprofen and etodolac (Table 4). Because of a cat's susceptibility to NSAID toxicity and aggra- vated by the lack of glucuronide metabolism in this species, NSMD use must be practiced with caution. Despite some re- ports of side effects, carprofen has been safely administered to cats after surgery, and appears equally efficacious with other NSAIDs. 25,26 Absolute contraindications to the use of NSMDs include renal or hepatic insufficiency, dehydration, hypoten- sion, heart failure, coagulopathies, concurrent use of other NSAIDs or corticosteroids, or signs of GI ulceration. Geriatric animals should be fully evaluated before and during ~use. NSAIDs can contribute to bleeding and, although this risk is greatly reduced with COX-2 drugs, many surgeons prefer to administer these drugs postoperatively. Preemptive analgesia is recommended, so opioid administration preoperatively and im- mediately postoperatively to provide analgesia during the NSAID onset is recommended. 24 Summary 9 Cats are highly susceptible to toxicity from use of NSAIDS 9 Unlike opioids there are absolute contraindications to the use of NSAIDS 9 Used with caution NSAIDS are extremely effective analgesics 9 NSAIDs are safest given postoperatively,
so adjunct use with opioids for preemptive analgesia is recommended or Agonists ~x-2 receptors are located peripherally in both presynaptic and postsynaptic sympathetic terminals as well as centrally in the brain and spinal cord near opioid receptors. Activation of cen- tral c~-2 receptors decreases excitatory activity, which provides profound sedation and analgesia. Undesirable central effects include decreased heart rate and contractility: Activation of peripheral receptors causes the undesirable effects of vasocon- striction, bradycardia, arrhythmias, and decreased stroke vol- ume. er agonists have synergistic effects with opioids and other anesthetic drugs, and do not lead to dysphoria or excite- ment. Xylazine (.05-0.1 mg/kg intravenously [IV] and .1-.2 mg/kg intramuscularly [IM] or subcutaneously [SQ]) and me- detomidine (:001-.01 mg/kg IV and 0.005~0.2 mg/kg IM or SQ) are the most common drugs of this class used in cats.

Individu- als in which opioid therapy is not possible because of tolerance or dysphoria and animals experiencing a rough recovery can be greatly improved with surprisingly small doses of c~-2 ago- nists. 2z Atipamezole
and yohimbine are available for reversal, but also must be used with caution in compromised patients as the reversal drugs also exert cardiovascular changes such as increased peripheral resistance and arrhythmias. Analgesia will be reversed as well as the undesirable effects of these drugs, so adequate analgesia should be established by some other method before reversal. Adjuncts to Analgesia Therapy Other sedatives and tranquilizers can augment analgesia via reduction of anxiety. Although having no analgesic efficacy alone, benzodiazepines and phenothiazines can affect the anx- iety-dependent component of pain and reduce opioid-induced excitement. Care should be taken, however, not to use tranquil- izers in place of appropriate analgesic therapy in painful ani- mals. Ketamine has been shown to be an effective drug for inhib- iting the facilitation of pain that occurs after a painful stimulus (wind-up). For extremely painful conditions, a constant rate infusion of ketamine in addition to opioids can dramatically improve analgesia, especially when initiated before the painful stimulus. 28,29 A loading dose of 0.5 mg/kg followed by an infu- sion of .01 mg/kg/min during surgery augments analgesia and reduces requirements for inhalant anesthetics. 28,29 The infu- sion rate is decreased to .002 mg/kg/min during recovery for 24 to 48 hours. This therapy is best combined with opioids, either via constant rate infusion of the opioid or with intermittent boluses. At these doses, behavioral changes are not usually observed, and people undergoing this therapy do not report changes in consciousness or hallucinations. Tricyclic antidepressants can be used at low doses to treat chronic pain conditions, although this is not validated in ani- mals, and may be primarily a result of the antidepressive effects of these drugs. 19 Amitriptyline 0.5-1.0 mg/kg by mouth (PO) daily may given with primary analgesics, such as opioids or NSAIDs, or with imipramine 0.5-1 mg/kg
PO twice per day to improve analgesia. 27 Acupuncture has been successfully employed to treat acute and chronic pain conditions with minimal systemic side ef- fects. 3~ There is growing popularity for nonpharmacologic treatments of pain such as acupuncture, and many clients are searching for such options. Local Anesthetic Drugs and Techniques Local anesthetic drugs work by blocking nerve transmission via sodium channel blockade. These drugs, therefore, do not just decrease pain transmission as do all previously mentioned drugsl but completely obliterate the pain stimulus before it reaches the spinal column. This can be an extremely helpful facet of multimodal analgesic therapy because pain sensitiza- tion can be blocked before it ever begins. Traditionally, veteri- narians have considered local techniques as a substitute for general anesthesia, and the concept of using local techniques in addition to general anesthesia for surgical procedures is a reemerging concept that provides low-cost multimodal anal- gesia. As with many other drugs, local anesthetic drugs seem to adial nerve R ;h Fig 1. Local block for feline declaw using lidocaine, mepiva- caine, or bupivacaine.

Reprinted with permission, TM have more pronounced toxicity in cats than other species. Care- ful attention to local anesthetic doses in cats is important to avoid toxicity because of their small size and reduced metabolic capability. Within
appropriate dose ranges, local anesthetics are quite safe (Table 5). 19,2~ Seizures can occur at excessive doses, and eventually cardiotoxicity may occur, especially with bupivacaine, which occasionally shows cardiotoxicity before seizures. Local damage to nerves can occur with local anesthet- ics, but is uncommon with isolated administration. Addition of epinephrine to local anesthetics will extend the duration of action, but it also increases the likelihood of local tissue dam- age. Epinephrine should only be added to locals in areas with adequate collateral circulation; it is contraindicated if the area being blocked is a distal extremity because it may cause necro- sis from hypoperfusion. Common sites for local anesthetic administration in cats include: 9 Incisional blocks before skin closure: Dilute calculated dose of drug to the volume needed to block the area. The drug should be injected 1 to 2 cm beyond the suture line on all sides so as not to interfere with healing 9 Declaw blocks for onychectomy (Fig 1) 9 Dental blocks for extractions/repairs 9 Epidurals for abdominal or hind limb procedures (Fig 2) 9 Brachial plexus block for forelimb procedure s distal to elbow 9 Intercostal or intrapleural blocks for thoracotomy Regional techniques are described in greater detail in several texts. 19-22 Use Caution when performing more than one block that the overall maximum dose of local anesthetics is not ex- ceeded. Dilute the maximum dose in saline or sterile water as needed to distribute between all sites. In conclusion, providing analgesia through a muhimodal approach including adequate preemptive coverage, postopera- tive supplementation, and local and regional techniques is medically beneficial. Although cats provide heightened chal- lenges to providing adequate analgesia, with a variety of drugs and techniques a pain-free patient can be achieved.

Introduction Felines are short-gestating multiparous animals, with great potential for producing numerous progeny that can reach sexual maturity after six months of age, according to the São Paulo State Department of Health. These factors associated with irresponsible pet guardians contribute to the uncontrolled population growth of dogs and cats. The World Health Organization states that isolated activities of collection and disposal of dogs and cats are not effective for population control. It is essential to act on the cause of the problem, that is, uncontrolled animal breeding and the lack of human responsibility for their care (WHO 1990). Surgical sterilization is the most indicated method for natality control, since they are minimally invasive techniques, preferably from eight weeks of age, reports Vieira (2008). The technique prevents breeding, avoids the transmission of Research, Society and Development, v. 10, n. 10, e564101019148, 2021 (CC BY 4.0) | ISSN 2525-3409 | DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.33448/rsd-v10i10.19148 3 venereal diseases, zoonoses and other diseases, such as uterine infection and mammary tumor in females and prostate tumor in males. It also reduces aggressiveness and the habit of urinating around the house (Andrade et al. 2012). However, for Paula and Molento (2012), every sterilization procedure represents a potential impact on the animal's well-being, especially during the immediate post-intervention period. In conventional ovariohysterectomy (OHE), somatic and visceral pain occurs, and may be mild to moderate, according to Gaynor (2009). In 1986, the International Association for the Study of Pain classified pain as an unpleasant sensory and/or emotional experience that is associated with actual or potential injuries. Every animal is capable of feeling
pain, any stimulus that causes pain in humans will also cause pain in animals, because they are endowed with anatomical and physiological components responsible for feeling pain. It is up to the veterinarian to identify and reduce this discomfort in the animal (Fantoni & Mastrocinque 2015; Silva 2018). 1.1 Pain physiology According to Martins and Flôr (2015), the way each animal feels pain is subjective, because it is related to the pain threshold that that animal has, according to the painful stimulus to which it was exposed. In veterinary medicine it is complicated to know the threshold of pain, since the animal does not speak, so it is essential that the veterinarian knows the pathophysiology of pain, particularities of the species and if the procedure he will do will cause pain in the animal. To understand the events that are present in the pathophysiology of pain, it is necessary to understand the processes of: transduction, peripheral sensitization, transmission, perception and modulation of pain (Fantoni & Mastrocinque 2012). Transduction is when a physical or chemical stimulus is transformed into an action potential, the action potential will leave the peripheral nerve fibers and will be transfered to the central nervous system (CNS), the transduction will give rise to the sensory-pain phenomenon. The stimulus will travel from the primary afferent fibers to the spinal cord and will be projected to the cortex, which is responsible for the conscious perception of pain (Fantoni & Mastrocinque 2012; Alves et al. 2017). Also according to Fantoni and Mastrocinque (2012), "the inflammatory response that occurs following tissue injury is accompanied by the release of a "soup of algogenic substances", which, acting synergistically, alter the sensitivity of the nociceptors". The transmission begins with the afferent nerve fibers, which carry the impulse to the grey substance of the dorsal
horn in the spinal cord. The spinal nerves conduct the transmission in the trunk and limbs, in the viscera it occurs by the sympathetic, parasympathetic and splanchnic nerves, and finally in the head region, it occurs by the trigeminal nerve (Aleixo et al. 2016). Several sites of the brain are responsible for the integration, processing and perception of pain information, the reticular activating system (RAS), participates in autonomic, motor and endocrine responses to pain. In the primary sensory cortex occurs the discrimination and localization of stimulus intensity, it modulates cognitive and affective aspects of the painful sensation (Fantoni & Mastrocinque 2012). Felines seem to be less likely to present behaviors suggestive of pain when compared to dogs in identical circumstances. This fact may contribute to undertreatment of pain (Otero 2005; Teixeira 2005). The cat has both physiological and behavioral characteristics that are important in pain assessment. However, physiological changes, e.g. heart and respiratory rate, pupillary size and neuroendocrine assays (cortisol, glucose, beta-endocrine etc.) are poorly correlated with acute pain in this species, in addition, anxiety, stress and fear affect these variables, especially in the hospital setting, according to Cambridge et al. (2000); Höglund et al. (2017). Therefore, pain assessment is mainly performed through subjective behavioral changes, which can often be subtle in felines, an example is the response to palpation (Monteiro & Steagall, 2018). Key behavioral indicators of abdominal pain in Research, Society and Development, v. 10, n. 10, e564101019148, 2021 (CC BY 4.0) | ISSN 2525-3409 | DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.33448/rsd-v10i10.19148 4 cats have been identified, which include abnormal postures (Waran et al. 2007). Another factor noted by Brondani et al. (2013) in painful cases is decreased appetite. It can be extremely difficult to assess the degree of pain experienced by animals and their ability to deal with pain (Mathews 2000).
In addition to understanding the pathophysiology of pain, it is necessary to know how to identify and assess pain in animals, for Martins and Flôr (2015), the methods responsible for this involve physiological, neuroendocrine and behavioral parameters. To assist the veterinarian, the scales for identification of pain in animals were created and the University of Melbourne Pain Scale (UMPS) is one of them, it is divided into six categories, based on physiological responses (heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, salivation and dilated pupil) and specific behavioral (response to palpation at the surgical site, activity, vocalization, posture, mental status), being assigned a score from zero to three, being zero for the animal that did not change its behavior or vital parameter, and a score of three for the animal that changed its behavior or vital parameter, indicating pain and/or discomfort (Pohl et al. 2011). The evaluation of multiple factors increases its sensitivity and specificity. However, it may not be sensitive enough to detect small changes in behavior (Ferreira, Braccini & Franklin, 2014). UMPS also requires the observer to know the animal's normal mental state prior to surgery and anesthesia (Hansen 2003; Hellyer 2005). Other scales are UNESP Botucatu Multidimensional Scale, Glasgow Composite Scale, Visual Analog Scale, Numerical Rating Scale, and the University of Colorado Pain Scale. It is essential that friendly handling techniques are done and that the location is calm, clean and warm, as the environment can help ameliorate the aversive aspects of hospitalization and pain (Rodan et al. 2011). Individual response to analgesic administration, individual behavior, age and concomitant illness should be considered in the acute pain assessment process (Monteiro & Steagall 2018). Information about the cats personality is extremely relevant and can be taken into consideration during the assessment. 1.2 Applied pharmacology The most frequently used classes of
drugs for pain control are those with analgesic potential, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids and others (Fantoni et al. 2002; Waran et al. 2010). NSAIDs are among the most used drugs in Veterinary Medicine (MacAllister, 1994); they act by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), which is involved in the inflammatory process and in central and peripheral pain sensitization (Landoni 2005; Bassanezi; Oliveira Filho 2006 apud Castro 2011), resulting in analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic action and can be used in both acute and chronic pain (Budsberd 2008; Teixeira 2010), but according to Pozzobon (2010), most produce side effects, such as gastrointestinal ulcers, kidney and liver damage, by inhibiting COX-1. Selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors were introduced to the market and meloxicam was one of the first (Pozzobon 2010). Meloxicam is considered an enolic acid-derived NSAID (Panara et al. 1999) and according to Curry et al. (2005), it also has analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Sodium dipyrone is a water-soluble pyrazolone derivative used as an analgesic, antipyretic and antispasmodic (Levy et al. 1995). According to Abbate et al. (1990), there is a central and peripheral action. The peripheral component is exerted by the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), inhibiting the formation of prostacyclins, prostaglandins and thromboxane, which prevents the sensitization of nociceptors. Other studies have described dipyrone as being able to inhibit an isoenzyme of COX type 3, present mainly in the cerebral cortex, a central mechanism by which the drug would exert its analgesic and antipyretic action (Chandrasekharan et al. 2002). Research, Society and Development, v. 10, n. 10, e564101019148, 2021 (CC BY 4.0) | ISSN 2525-3409 | DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.33448/rsd-v10i10.19148 5 Tramadol hydrochloride is in the class of centrally acting analgesics, which inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, thus acting as an α-agonist. It also has moderate affinity for the μ-opioid receptor
(Lee et al. 1993; Raffa et al. 1993). Non-opioid mechanisms can potentiate analgesia without respiratory and cardiac depression (Vickers et al. 1992). According to Luna (2008), the advancement of science and animal welfare has increased the critical sense of the need for pain prevention and treatment in animals. Then, due to its importance, pain and its control are subjects that are being increasingly studied (Tranquilli et al. 2013). 2. Methodology The study was developed at the Veterinary School Hospital (HVE) of the Universidade Estadual do Norte do Paraná (UENP) and at the Veterinary Clinic Auqmia, in the city of Bandeirantes, Paraná, between 2016 and 2020. The activities began after approval by the Ethics Committee on Animal Use (ECAU) of UENP (Protocol: 03/2018). There were 30 females of the feline specie selected from Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), so the clinical history was limited due to the lack of information on each animal. In the preoperative consultation, 12 hours solid and a four hours water fast was recommended preoperatively, an anamnesis of the animals was performed, as well as a general physical examination, mucosal staining, and capillary refill time, in addition to checking heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature and degree of hydration. A pre-surgical hematological evaluation was also performed, which included: blood count, leukogram, and platelet count. The cats were tranquilized with acepromazine hydrochloride 0.05 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg), followed by morphine (0.2 mg/kg) and cephalothin (30 mg/kg). After 15 minutes, the abdomen was trichotomized. Anesthetic induction was obtained by the application of propofol (5 mg/kg) intravenously. The animals were sent to the operating room, where anesthesia was maintained with isofluorane in 100% oxygen, with assisted ventilation and a calibrated vaporizer. The animals received 0.9% sodium chloride intravenously (I.V.) until the moment of extubation. The animals were operated on by different surgeons,
all proficient in the proposed technique. Three postoperative analgesic protocols were elaborated, being them Protocol 1 (PG1), composed of dipyrone (25 mg/kg SID) and containing 10 female cats, Protocol 2 (PG2), Protocol 2 (PG2), consisting of dipyrone (25 mg/kg SID) associated with tramadol (3 mg/kg TID) and containing 10 cats, and finally, Protocol 3 (PG3), consisting of dipyrone (25 mg/kg SID) associated with meloxicam (0.1 mg/kg SID) and containing 10 cats, described in Table 1. Table 1. Analgesic protocols for the feline specie.

The surgical wounds were cleaned by the guardians with 0.9% sodium chloride solution and 1% chlorhexidine digliconate for seven days, and then the sutures were removed on the tenth day.

In the evaluation by means of UMPS, in addition to the observation of the animal’s behavior and palpation of the surgical incision, the values of heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and rectal temperature (RT) were measured, as well as the presence of salivation and pupil dilation, scored according to the categories evaluated in the scale previously described by Firth and Haldane (1999) cited by Oliveira (2016). The analgesic rescue is performed when the sum of the scores reaches 9 or more, and is done with ketoprofen 2 mg/kg, intramuscular (I.M.), with previous administration of omeprazole orally with a concentration of 10 mg.

Results and Discussion None of the means exceeded the score considered over moderate pain according to UMPS. However, in protocol PG1, four animals presented values over 9 at T24, as well as one animal at T48, requiring analgesic rescue. In relation to protocol G2, three animals presented high values at T24, so rescue was also performed. Finally, in protocol PG3, one animal presented a high score at T4 and two at T24, so rescue was performed. The protocols performed along with the scores for each animal are seen in the following tables. Table 3. PG1 analgesic

Analysis of variance ANOVA and later Tukey's test were also performed; for one of the times, (T72), it was necessary to use the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test due to the fact that the treatment at this time did not meet the normality assumptions. The data were run in Rstudio software (Version 1.3.1056). For the normality test, it is understood that the p value needs to be greater than 0.05 (p > 0.05). At T4, the value of W was 0.98206, while in Tukey's Test, the p-value was 0.8773. In the case of A value, it was 0.25237, while the p value was 0.7137. Therefore, the data fit the normal distribution for both tests. Equal letters in the column Groups do not differ significantly from each other (ANOVA and Tukey's a posteriori test; p < 0.05) (Table 6). Equal letters in the means column do not differ significantly from each other. Table 6. Pain scale means by treatment analyzed after 4 hours (T4).

The treatment of post-surgical pain is extremely important for ethical and humanitarian reasons and to prevent the occurrence of deleterious effects on the body, such as on the metabolic, neuroendocrine and immune systems resulting from pain (Desborough 2000; Mui, 2008). The selection of ovariohysterectomy was based on the fact that it is common in the surgical routine and for favoring the population control of stray animals. It should be noted that, although many studies recommend pain assessment in a control group (without analgesia), it did not occur in this study, justified by ethical and animal welfare reasons, since it is a surgery that promotes pain, according to Paulo (2014). Dipyrone is an analgesic widely used for pain control and as an antipyretic, but there are few published studies on its efficacy and safety in animals, especially felines. In the case of meloxicam, Mathews (2000), points out that NSAIDs have a longer period of action when compared to opioids, and it is possible to mention tramadol hydrochloride. This fact can be observed when comparing PG2 with PG3, because the latter has considerably lower values. Research, Society and Development, v. 10, n. 10, e564101019148, 2021 (CC BY 4.0) | ISSN 2525-3409 | DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.33448/rsd-v10i10.19148 10 Coleman (2007) states that several studies show that cats receive less analgesia than dogs under the same condition. Smith et al.
(1996), adds that this is due to the fact that it is hardly evaluated in this species because in the presence of pain, cats remain silent. Other factors are the limited choice of analgesics and the fear of side effects. However, it is known that felines are the fastest growing pets in terms of population in Brazil (Brazil 2015), and there is also an increase in veterinary care for this species. Thus, it is extremely important to know about analgesia in order to provide well-being. 4. Conclusions Due to the inability of verbal communication and recognition, pain assessment becomes a challenge, therefore, it is essential to know the ethology, environmental, physiological and behavioral variations of the species studied, besides considering the animal as a unique being. In the current study, there was no statistically significant difference because the sample number (N) was low; therefore, it was concluded that increasing the number of animals in the study will lead to relevant differences between treatments. Even so, the association between dipyrone sodium and meloxicam showed the lowest mean and median, indicating more effective analgesia. In view of this, studies with meloxicam alone will be necessary for a possible comparison with dipyrone. However, due to the absence of significant difference, dipyrone becomes a viable option, especially for its low cost. References Abbate, R., Gori, A.

C O R R E S P O N D E N C E Gabapentin as part of multi-modal analgesia in two cats suffering multiple injuries We would like to report our experience using gaba- pentin in two cats which had suffered major trauma resulting from a road trafﬁc accident (RTA). Pain scoring for both cats utilized a modiﬁed 4avet scale (Coppens et al. 2001). Table 1 provides a summary of the pain scores, and of the dosage and frequency of administration of analgesic drugs for both cats. Cat 1 A 16-month-old male neutered Domestic Short Hair (DSH) was presented with diaphyseal fractures of the left distal tibia and ﬁbula and a transverse fracture of the right talus. During the ﬁrst 2 days of hospitalization, intravenous (IV) buprenorphine (Vetergesic; Alstoe Ltd, UK) and per os (PO) melo- xicam (Metacam; Boehringer Ingelheim, UK) were administered for analgesia. The animal appeared comfortable, had a good appetite and was able to urinate spontaneously. The initial surgery stabilized the tibial fracture with a plate. Extradural (L7-S1) morphine (0.1 mg kg)1, Morphine 1% Preservative Free; Martindale, UK) with bupivacaine (1 mg kg)1, Marcaine 0.5%; AstraZeneca, UK) were injected preoperatively. Postoperative analgesia consisted of meloxicam and methadone (Physeptone; Martindale, UK) administered intramuscularly (IM) if the pain score ‡ 4/12. This resulted in the administration of methadone every 4 hours overnight. A second surgical procedure 36 hours later carried out pan- tarsal arthrodesis. In order to provide perioperative analgesia, a sciatic nerve block (bupivacaine, 1 mg kg)1) was performed. Meloxicam administra- tion was continued postoperatively and methadone administered every 4 hours. The following morning
the cat was alert, relaxed and friendly. However, gentle touch of the cervical and thoracolumbar area consistently elicited an aggressive response. Gabapentin (10 mg kg)1 PO every 8 hours, Gabapentin; TEVA, UK) administra- tion was then commenced. Twenty-four hours later, the animal appeared more comfortable, and did not respond to touch or bandage changes. Methadone administration was then stopped and IM buprenor- phine administration commenced – initially every 6 hours for 24 hours, then only if necessary on the basis of pain score. No further buprenorphine was required 72 hours after the second surgery. The cat was discharged 5 days after the ﬁnal surgery with the instruction to continue administration of gaba- pentin (10 mg kg)1 PO every 8 hours) for 2 weeks and meloxicam (0.1 mg kg)1 PO every 24 hours) for 5 days. Cat 2 A 15-month-old male neutered DSH was referred 4 days after a RTA. Injuries consisted of a fracture of the left tarsus, instability of the right stiﬂe and split fracture of the symphysis of the mandible. Pre- anaesthetic blood screening demonstrated acute renal failure: azotaemia was 88.2 mmol L)1 (refer- ence interval 6–10); creatinine 1058 lmol L)1 (reference interval 40–150); K+ 9 mmol L)1 (refer- ence interval 3.6–5.6); inorganic phosphate 5 mmol L)1 (reference interval 1–2.46); further, absent P and tall T waves were recorded on elec- trocardiographic investigation. Initially, medical treatment consisted of NaCl 0.9% with 2.5% dex- trose infusion, administration of Ca2+ gluconate, glucose boluses and insulin, and furosemide. During the ﬁrst week of hospitalization azotaemia, creati- nine, electrolytes and urine output were measured routinely; ﬂuid therapy was adjusted accordingly. Ultrasound examination detected neither bladder rupture, nor free abdominal ﬂuid. A gastrostomy tube was endoscopically placed and used to 518 Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia, 2011, 38, 518–520 doi:10.1111/j.1467-2995.2011.00638.x administer both ﬂuid and
food. During this period buprenorphine was administered IV every 6 hours for analgesia. The surgical procedure utilized an external ﬁxator for pantarsal arthrodesis and an extracapsular technique to stabilize the stiﬂe. Perioperative anal- gesia was provided by administering morphine (30 lg kg)1) and bupivacaine (0.25 mg kg)1) intrathecally, at the L5-L6 intervertebral space. Postoperative pain was treated initially with meth- adone administered IM according to the pain score. The following day, the cat appeared comfortable; however gently touching the thoracolumbar spine evoked a pain response. Administration of gabapen- tin (10 mg kg)1 PO every 8 hours) was commenced and methadone was administered IM every 5 hours for the ﬁrst 24 hours, then only if necessary, which it was not as 24 hours after the ﬁrst gabapentin administration pain scores < 4, and the cat did not react to the palpation of thoracolumbar area. A week later the animal was discharged with instruc- tions to continue administration of gabapentin (10 mg kg)1 PO every 8 hours) for 2 weeks. Gabapentin is a drug chemically related to c- aminobutyric acid (GABA) and binds Ca2+ a2-delta receptors mainly in dorsal horn of the spinal cord and forebrain (Siao et al. 2010); it is used as an anticonvulsant in veterinary and human medicine, and as an adjunctive analgesic in humans (Platt et al. 2006). In veterinary anaesthesia, gabapentin has been investigated clinically as analgesic only in dogs undergoing forelimb amputation (Wagner et al. 2010) and in an acute pain model in cats (Pypendop et al. 2010) using a thermal stimulus; in both cases a signiﬁcant analgesic effect could not be demonstrated. Pain management in cats with multiple injuries is challenging: opioids alone do not always produce adequate analgesia and in some situations may cause hyperalgesia. Non steroidal anti-inﬂamma- tory drugs (NSAIDs) may be contraindicated
in subjects where shock, hypovolaemia, severe liver contusion or renal dysfunction are present. Continuous nociceptive inputs may cause tem- porary or permanent changes in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, leading to hyperalgesia and allodynia. In humans these conditions are success- fully treated with gabapentin, therefore we decided to administer gabapentin in the two cats here reported as opioids and NSAIDs were failing fully to control the pain. In our institution gabapentin (10 mg kg)1 PO every 8 hours) often is used postoperatively in dogs and cats after spinal surgery. At this dose gabapentin is characterized by low volume of distribution and slow clearance in the feline species (Siao et al. 2010).

Therefore, its effect should be care- fully monitored and its administration suspended should side effects – such as lethargy, depression and ataxia, occur. Nevertheless, gabapentin as adjuvant for the treatment of hyperalgesia and allodynia in cats should be considered in a clinical setting, although further investigation is needed to better characterize its’ effects.

They then explain how and why NSAIDs can have such positive and, potentially, negative actions. They consider the best ways of enhancing owner and cat compliance, make suggestions about sensible dosing frequencies, timing of medication and accuracy of dosing, and emphasize the importance of always using the ‘lowest effective dose’. They even cover the things that need to be considered when switching between NSAIDs. They discuss the common concurrent conditions that, while not necessarily precluding the use of NSAIDs, require careful consideration in terms of pros, cons and potential complications – including renal disease, gastrointestinal disease, cardiovascular disease and liver disease. They make a number of recommendations relating to the importance of pre-treatment screening, and the potential for interaction between NSAIDs and concomitant drug therapy (eg, glucocorticoids and anticoagulants). They ultimately help to classify those patients that may have a higher risk of developing side effects, and hence need very careful monitoring during therapy. They tabulate detailed dosing information for each of the NSAIDs that have so far been licensed in cats, as well as suggested monitoring protocols. Although data are still limited and NSAIDs have only recently become licensed for long- term use in cats
in some countries, the panel conclude that this group of drugs has a major role to play in the management of chronic pain in this species. However, they underline that careful patient selection, dose titration and ongoing monitoring for the early signs of toxicity are essential.

This issue of JFMS contains the first ever international consensus guidelines on the long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in cats. This timely publication, which appears on pages 521–538 (doi:10.1016/j.jfms.2010.05.004), is a collaborative enterprise by the International Society of Feline Medicine (ISFM) and American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP). It has been compiled by a panel of world leaders in the understanding of pain in cats and, without doubt, is essential reading for all small animal veterinary surgeons. It is interesting to reflect that although the first use of NSAIDs was probably by Hippocrates (some time between 460 BC and 377 BC), when he administered powder made from the bark and leaves of willow trees to help heal headaches, pains and fevers, it has taken until now for cats to gain the benefit of the long-term use of these drugs. Although NSAIDs have been available for dogs for many years, there has been a reluctance to consider their use in cats. While it is classically presumed that this relates to worries about potential drug toxicity, it is also likely that it stems
from our inability to recognize pain in cats as easily as we do in dogs. This is perhaps not surprising, as cats tend to hide their pain. It’s a strategy that makes perfect sense evolutionarily, as cats are solitary hunters and would have nothing to gain from showing pain – and plenty to lose (notably the risk of getting eaten by larger carnivores or primates). The guidelines have been produced to help us all to use NSAIDs effectively and safely in cats.

While most published data on their use in this species relate to short-term (often perioperative) therapy, there is increasing evidence of the value of these drugs in treating chronic pain in cats (for example, that associated with degenerative joint disease), and some NSAIDs have now become licensed for long-term use in cats in some geographies. Most of our knowledge of therapeutic mechanisms or adverse drug reactions associated with NSAIDs is extrapolated from work in other species, and there is a paucity of published data relating to cats. Guidelines These guidelines have been drawn together by an expert panel, which have reviewed the current literature on long-term NSAID use in cats and other species, and developed guidance on their use based on this information. The aim is to provide practical information for veterinarians to encourage appropriate NSAID therapy whenever cats will benefit from the use of these drugs. Introduction Pain in cats has many negative effects, both physiological and emotional.1,2 It is now accepted that there is no such thing as ‘good pain’ following surgery and during treatment for trauma or disease – eg, pain that inhibits potentially deleterious movement after sur- gery. Pain delays recovery, impacts negatively on a patient’s wellbeing, and disturbs the bond with its owner and also the veterinary team.1,3 Studies have looked at the use of non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for acute,
especially perioperative, pain in cats.4–7 Surveys have shown clinicians were more likely to treat pain in dogs than cats,8,9 as a result of dif- ficulties in recognizing pain, lack of knowledge concerning the use of analgesics, and fear of drug side effects in cats. Less has been published on the management of chronic pain in cats, but it is recognized that signs may be subtle and include withdrawing from attention, decreased mobility, reduced interactions with humans and other animals, poor appetite and aggression.10–12 JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE521 Chronic pain can be regarded as pain that has persisted for more than 2–3 weeks, often persists months or years, and may continue beyond the anticipated healing time. Importantly, chronic pain can become dissociat- ed from the inciting cause and be maladaptive, such that the degree of pain does not necessar- ily correlate with the pathology observed or perceived by the individual, and is not associat- ed with healing.12 Multimodal analgesia is commonly advocated, but it is becoming evident that NSAIDs will play a key role in managing chronic feline pain, especially mus- culoskeletal pain, just as they do in humans and dogs.10,13–16 Until quite recently, while many NSAIDs have been available to treat dogs with degenerative joint disease (DJD),17 only a restricted range has been licensed for short- term (up to a few days) use in cats. At the time of writing, at least one NSAID – meloxicam – has been licensed for long-term use in cats in many regions of the world, transforming our ability to manage pain in this species, and a second – robenacoxib – has been licensed for up Collaborating to build a future of unparallelled cat care by: Raising the profile of the cat in the veterinary clinic Creating continuing education opportunities for veterinary care professionals Developing practice

FIG 3 Watson, a DJD sufferer, enjoying the benefits of daily NSAID treatment clinical disease is present many owners may simply assume a cat is ‘getting old’, and even educated and attentive owners may not neces- sarily appreciate suffering associated with DJD without veterinary observation and insight. In the absence of medical intervention, many cats with DJD suffer pain and discomfort for years, greatly affecting their quality of life and the human/feline bond. It is vital that examina- tions of the older feline patient should specifi- cally address whether DJD is present, through history and physical examination and, where necessary, radiology and therapeutic trials. Control of bodyweight, exercise and environ- mental modifications may help cats with DJD, as may other medical therapies. However, the dramatic responses reported to NSAIDs13,21,23 indicate that there is a huge scope for safe, effective long-term NSAID therapy in the large cohort of aged cats with DJD (Fig 3). to 6 days of therapy in cats (see Table 1, page 529).* There is little doubt that others will become licensed for long-term use in the future, due to the recognition of the need and value for such NSAID therapy in this species.10,11,13–15,18 Clinicians are aware of their duty to promote animal welfare and relieve suffering, but are also often reminded of Hippocrates’ advice to ‘first do no harm’. This is often rightly used to question whether an intervention will actually do more harm than good, and to withhold that intervention when doubts exist. However, we need also to recognize that withholding treat- ments
such as analgesics can sometimes cause the greater harm, because we are no longer addressing the pain and suffering the animal is enduring. In drawing up these guidelines, the international panel of experts’ purpose has been to review the current literature on long- term NSAID use in cats, and to provide practi- cal guidance on their use. The overarching aim is to encourage more widespread and appro- priate NSAID therapy, when cats will benefit from the use of these drugs. However, most of our knowledge of therapeutic mechanisms or adverse drug reactions is extrapolated from work in other species, as there is a paucity of published data relating to cats. Common causes of chronic pain and inflammation in cats One of the difficulties in managing pain in cats is its initial recognition. It is important, therefore, to be aware of common causes of pain and to have a high index of suspicion for signs and behaviors potentially related to pain. If something is painful to us, it is likely to be painful to a cat. Degenerative joint disease The most common cause of chronic feline pain is thought to be DJD, and this has been the sub- ject of a number of important studies in the past 10 years.11,15,16,18–24 From these studies, it is clear that DJD is very common, with radio graphic changes affecting up to 60–90% of cats (Figs 1 and 2),18,24 that it affects both the spine and the appendicular joints, and that it occurs especial- ly commonly in older patients.18,24 The hips, stifle, shoulder, elbow, tarsus and spine are the most common sites affected, although other joints can also be involved. Studies based on radiographic findings have limitations, though, as the changes observed do not necessarily cor- respond to clinical disease, or the severity of clinical
disease and pain. Nevertheless, where 522 JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs Pain delays recovery, impacts negatively on a patient’s wellbeing, and disturbs the bond with its owner and also the veterinary team.

Other diseases There are many other feline diseases where control of protracted inflammation and pain is important. These include various cancers (Fig 4a), particularly where definitive treatment is not possible, or in some cases for the anti - neoplastic effect NSAIDs may offer.25–28 Other common conditions associated with chronic pain where NSAIDs may form part of therapy include trauma, lymphoplasmacytic gingivo - stomatitis (Fig 5),29 idiopathic cystitis,30,31 skin disease and uveitis (Fig 6). In the last, both topical and/or systemic NSAID therapy may be valuable.32 Through their antipyretic effect, control of fever with NSAIDs may also be valuable in some situations. A short therapeu- tic trial of an NSAID without a definitive diag- nosis may sometimes be appropriate, using the response to treatment as a guide to diag- nosis and further therapy.

They exert these effects mostly through inhibiting the production of prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) by the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) and 5-lipoxy- genase (5-LOX) enzymes, respectively.33–35 Most NSAIDs primarily inhibit the activity of COX enzymes. Although some also inhibit LOX enzymes, for currently licensed feline drugs this is generally short-lived in compari- son with COX inhibition, and evidence of additional clinical efficacy from this is lacking. More effective dual COX/LOX inhibitors may become available in the future.36–38 Two distinct COX isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) have been identified as being respon- sible for the production of prostaglandins (Fig 7).35 A third isoform has also been identi- fied, initially known as COX-3, now described as a splice-variant of COX-1, which seems to have a role in the central control of pain.38 Phospholipase A2 is the rate-limiting enzyme that initiates the COX pathway by liberating arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane-bound phospholipids. Both COX isoforms are then responsible for converting AA to PGG2 and PGH2 via identical enzymatic reactions. Following these initial steps, PGH2 functions as an intermediate substrate for the biosyn - thesis, by specific synthases and isomerases, of prostaglandins, prostacyclin and throm - boxanes. COX-1 converts AA to a range of mol
ecules, including thromboxanes (TX), such as thromboxane A2 (TXA2), and prostaglandins, such as PGD2, PGE2 and PGF2, and prostacyclin (PGI2). COX-2 activity pro- duces a narrower spectrum of prostaglandins, specifically PGE2, and prostacyclin. The prostaglandins play a major role in many aspects of normal physiology, including vascular homeostasis, gastroprotection, renal development and blood flow, blood clotting, reproduction, bone metabolism, wound heal- ing, nerve development and growth, and immune responses. They are also involved in pathophysiological processes, including pain and inflammation, and cancer progression. However, much of our knowledge is extrapo- lated from other species, as there is a paucity of feline-specific data. Expression of COX enzymes Both COX-1 and COX-2 are enzymes that are constitutively expressed (normally present in tissues and at fairly constant concentrations), as well as induced (appear and/or increase in concentration in response to an inciting factor, often associated with inflammation). COX-1 is considered as predominantly constitutive, being expressed in almost all tissues, and involved in the production of prostaglandins responsible for ‘house-keeping’ functions, such as the cytoprotective effects in the gastric mucosa, normal platelet function and mainte- nance of renal perfusion.39 Constitutive expression of COX-2 appears to be more FIG 7 Overview of the role of COX and LOX in prostanoid production Arachidonic acid 5-HPETE PGG2 PGG2 PGH2 PGD2 PGE2 PGI2 LTB4 LTC4 LTD4 LTE4 PGF2 PGE2 PGI2 TXA2 PGH2 LTA4 Phospholipase A2 Phospholipid cell membrane PGH2 synthases PGH2 synthases COX-1 COX-1 COX-2 COX-2 LOX LOX S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE525 restricted,39,40 although it is present, along with COX-1, in the central nervous system, kidney, vascular endothelium, reproductive tract and gastrointestinal (GI) tract – sites where COX-2 activity contributes to homeo- static functions.35,41 It appears that COX-2 has an important role in healing damaged mucosa
in the GI tract, and although COX-2 has been shown to be constitutively expressed in the canine GI tract,42,43 informa- tion on cats is lacking. While COX-1 is the predominant constitu- tively produced enzyme, COX-2 is predom- inantly inducible and its production is dra- matically upregulated during inflammation, in which it plays a central role.44 The expres- sion of COX-2 may also be upregulated in certain neoplasms, and in cats variable expression has been reported in transitional cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, mammary carcinomas and pancreatic carci- nomas.25–28,45–47 However, just as COX-2 has some constitutive expression, COX-1 expression also has a role to play in the inflammatory response.39,40 COX and LOX selectivity, and NSAID adverse effects Inhibition of COX-1, the enzyme predomi- nantly associated with homeostatic func- tions, is reported to be the cause of most NSAID-induced side effects such as gastric ulcers and blood dyscrasias. In an attempt to avoid this, NSAIDs with a greater propensi- ty to suppress COX-2 than COX-1, so-called ‘COX-2 preferential’ (or ‘COX-1 sparing’) NSAIDs, have been developed. Drugs that have negligible effect on COX-1 have been termed ‘COX-2 selective’ rather than ‘prefer- ential’, although there is no recognized pre- cise definition of these terms.48 However, it rapidly became evident from human studies that COX-2 preferential or selective NSAIDs, while reducing some of the side effects classically associated with COX-1 inhibition, still caused adverse events such as acute renal failure, thromboembolic disease and gastric ulceration,49,50 consistent with a physiological role for COX-2 in a number of tissues. For example, both COX-1 and COX-2 are expressed in mam- malian kidneys. They are found within dif- ferent cells of the kidney (macula densa, cor- tical ascending tubule, medullary interstitial cells), and play different roles, but both are important to preserve renal function during hypovolemia.50 Additionally, the inhibition
of COX has been postulated to be associated with an increase in LOX activity, which can result in adverse effects on the GI mucosa. Furthermore, it has been suggested that dual inhibitors may be associated with fewer GI adverse effects than COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors. Although the COX/LOX selectivity of an NSAID may be important, this does not negate all potential side effects, and indeed evaluation of COX/LOX selectivity is not the only factor to consider when trying to predict the safety of an NSAID. There are several other issues to consider. Firstly, the risks of adverse events can be affected by tissue concentrations of the drug – where the extracellular fluid is of a lower pH than the intracellular fluid, ‘ion trapping’ of weakly acidic drugs, such as most NSAIDs, can occur with accumulation of the drug with- in cells (eg, the gastric mucosa).51 The extent to which this occurs will vary between drugs but this local accumulation can affect the prevalence of side effects. Secondly, differences are recognized between species in both the expression and distribution of the COX enzymes.52–55 Very little feline-specific data are available, but there could be differences in susceptibility to adverse events as a result of such differences in cats. Thirdly, there are substantial variations in the reported COX selectivity of an NSAID based on the type of in vitro assay used to measure COX-1 and COX-2 activity. These results vary depending on the species used to source the material for the assay; and, even when the assay is performed in tissue from the target species, different assays yield different results.36,38,56 Additionally, differences in metab- olism of drugs between species can result in differing selectivity. In the dog, tepoxalin is a dual inhibitor for a short period of time only; but, in the cat,
tepoxalin pharmacokinetics indi- cate it is potentially a balanced COX and LOX inhibitor throughout its kinetic profile.38 Other factors also affect the risk of adverse events – for example, age. Older humans are recognized to be at greatest risk of GI ulcera- tion; and in human medicine pre-existing renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease and hepatic disease are all relative contraindica- tions for use of NSAIDs. However, manage- ment of pain in the geriatric patient becomes critical to quality of life. Therefore, careful selection of NSAIDs and their dose, and the use of adjunctive therapies (such as proton pump inhibitors to assist gastroprotection, other analgesics to modulate other parts of the pain pathway and reduce the required NSAID dose, and fluid therapy to minimize effects of hypovolemia), must be considered rather than simply avoiding addressing pain in both humans57–60 and veterinary species.61 Patient selection, dose titration and ongoing monitoring for the early signs of toxicity are essential.62,63 What does this mean for cats? Because of species differences in expression of COX enzymes and in the in vitro COX selec- tivity assays, it is imprudent to generalize results from any single study.64 With all these variables, it is not surprising that there is no simple answer to the question of whether a COX selective or a dual COX/LOX inhibitor is better, and indeed what the ‘ideal’ COX/LOX selectivity and profile of an NSAID is in the cat. It may indeed depend on the disease process and the individual being treated. Despite these caveats, and given the paucity of feline-specific data at present, we can only cautiously extrapolate knowledge based on data from other species. Practical NSAID therapy in cats Beyond the question of COX selectivity, many other factors are also important in choosing and using NSAIDs for long-term therapy in cats. Compliance Administering
medication to cats can be challenging for owners, yet adequate therapy relies on good owner compliance. Along with NSAIDs, many cats will be receiving other medications and the ‘administration burden’ may be daunting for owners, leading to incon- sistent dosing. To help long-term use, a drug should ideally be highly palatable and taken voluntarily by the cat – for example, in food or as a treat – and veterinary pharmaceutical companies undertake much research into this.65 Published studies suggest meloxicam liquid is highly palatable in cats,13,16 with one study suggesting it was significantly more palatable than ketoprofen tablets.16 Other drugs may be compounded in specific flavors that are appealing to individual cats. 526 JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs However, it is important to follow all regula- tions and compliance policies for drug com- pounding,66 which are different throughout the world, and to consider the potential effect of compounding on bioavailability and stability/ shelf-life. Additionally, owners must be consistent and remember to administer the drug. Based on the long duration of action of many NSAIDs in cats, this should be at a set time on treatment days. Creative reminder systems may help ensure cats receive medication on the correct day(s), at the correct time(s) and at the correct dose. Giving medication along with a daily food ration (which should also be done for safety) can provide a built-in reminder system for owners, and encourage owner involvement in the monitoring process. Dosing – intervals, frequency, timing and the ‘lowest effective dose’ Short-term pharmacokinetic data are available for a number of NSAIDs in cats, which form a basis for dosing intervals. While many NSAIDs are metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, and the relative deficiency of glucuronyl transferase enzymes in cats may
lead to a prolonged half-life for some of these drugs,37,56 others, such as piroxicam and meloxicam,56,67 are metabolized by oxidation. Single doses of many approved/licensed NSAIDs for acute pain in cats seem to have a duration of action of around 18–20 h.56 However, it is not known if such prolonged pharmacokinetics are necessary for appropri- ate efficacy. For example, meloxicam and robenacoxib have a serum half-life of approx- imately 24 and 2 h, respectively,68,69 yet both have been shown to be effective for daily treatment of musculoskeletal pain in cats by virtue of their European licenses. COX-2 selectivity Panel recommendations In keeping with other species, studies of NSAIDs in cats suggest no difference in anti-inflammatory or analgesic efficacy between COX non-selective drugs and variably COX-2 selective inhibitors. It is presumed, as in other species, that using drugs with a greater COX-2 selectivity in cats will help avoid some of the potential adverse effects associated with COX-1 suppression, such as GI irritation/ulceration and platelet inhibition. However, selective COX-2 inhibition will not completely negate the possibility of adverse effects and may not confer any renoprotective effect in comparison with a non-selective inhibitor. It is presumed that dual inhibition of COX and LOX may be associated with reduced GI adverse effects over COX inhibition alone. However, it is unlikely that dual inhibition will completely negate the possibility of adverse effects. JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE527 S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs For most of the NSAIDs used in cats, it is not known if repeated long-term dosing alters the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the drug. In one study, the administration of flunixin daily for 7 days appeared to result in more rapid metabolism of the drug after 7 days and decreased pharmacodynamic effects,70 although the same did not
appear to be evident during daily administration of meloxicam for 7 days.68 Additionally, informa- tion on the apparent efficacy of daily versus every-other-day or less frequent dosing is anecdotal, with no controlled studies yet pub- lished. Daily dosing of meloxicam at less than the labelled dose for a mean of 5.8 months was considered to be clinically effective and asso- ciated with minimal adverse effects in one non-blinded study,13 although efficacy was not measured objectively or with a validated assessment system. However, due to the inter- cat variability of pharmacokinetics with administration of a variety of NSAIDs, it is likely that daily dosing may be appropriate for some cats, while longer intervals might be appropriate for others. Unfortunately there is no practical way to determine which cats might be ‘fast’ metabo- lizers and which slower. Additionally, proba- bly as a result of their high protein-binding, which may enable NSAIDs to persist in inflamed tissue sites for longer than in plasma, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity of these drugs often persists longer than would be predicted from their serum half-life. This may enable daily dosing even for drugs with a relatively short half-life.38,69 Indeed persistence at the site of inflammation has been demonstrated in an experimental study of robenacoxib in cats.67 It is, therefore, unlikely that a set mg/kg dose and dosing schedule will work equally well for all cats; furthermore, variations in the level of pain may alter the cat’s needs over time. Very little attention has been given to the best time of day to administer NSAIDs to cats to achieve the most beneficial effect, a concept termed chronotherapy.71 Theoretically, long-term dosing may result in a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state. However, ‘peaks and troughs’ may still occur. If the peak beneficial effect on lameness occurs at say 5 h
after dosing, treat- ment may be tailored to achieve maximum clinical effect when the cat is most active. The timing, therefore, may depend on a cat’s lifestyle. Alternatively, an owner may find that at ‘peak effect’ the cat is more comfortable, it rests for longer and may choose to administer the drug to promote resting and sleeping at the most suitable time for the household. Dosing – accuracy Dosing accuracy will depend on the formula- tion of the drug. Liquids are more easily measured, and can be delivered in small volumes. Thus incremental increases or decreases in dose are potentially more readily achieved. However, differing dispensing methods can potentially result in wide varia- tions in doses. Tablets or caplets are not Dosing frequency Panel recommendations To avoid potential side effects, owners should be encouraged to work on titrating to the ‘lowest effective dose’ that works for their cat, with the understanding that this may change over time. This dose may often be less than the labelled dose.13,14,21 In overweight or obese cats, it is prudent to calculate initial doses for NSAIDs according to their lean or ideal bodyweight. When attempting to reduce the overall dose of an NSAID, it would seem prudent to reduce the label dose but maintain the label frequency, where possible. The panel recognize that intermittent therapy, for example 2–3 times weekly rather than daily, is better than no therapy at all, and anecdotally appears efficacious in some cats. However, there may be a risk of significant periods of time when no effective therapy, or suboptimal therapy, is being achieved. Intermittent drug withdrawal, a reduced frequency of dosing, or a reduction of the dose may all help owners to assess drug efficacy. The panel see little rationale for pulse therapy with NSAIDs unless the underlying disease process
varies sufficiently in severity that it does not require consistent analgesic/anti-inflammatory therapy. Treatment may be tailored to achieve maximum clinical effect when the cat is most active. Alternatively, an owner may choose to administer the drug to promote resting and sleeping at the most suitable time for the household. Monitoring efficacy There is no validated assessment tool for acute or chronic feline pain, although studies are ongoing.72 In studies evaluating the efficacy of NSAIDs in cats with musculoskeletal pain, improved mobility, and in particular the will- ingness to jump and the height of the jump, have been the most obvious signs of improve- ment,13,21 and another study found increases in mobility with administration of an NSAID.15 One key feature of chronic pain assessment is owner involvement and obser- vation, especially as pain may manifest in different ways in individual cats.56,73 It has been postulated that four behavioral domains – mobility, activity, grooming and tempera- ment – are particularly useful to both clinicians and owners in assessing chronic musculoskeletal pain and monitoring the response to therapy.23 When treating animals with long-term dis- eases, an overall assessment of ‘quality of life’ may be beneficial; this includes, but is not lim- ited to, pain. An assessment tool may need to be individually designed since what is impor- tant to each patient will be different: can the cat climb trees, hunt, play with other pets in the household, and so on?15 This was the thinking behind the use of client-specific out- come measures in a recent study.15 Owners should keep a regular journal or diary of the cat’s activities, as changes in mobility and behavior may be subtle and occur slowly. The owner is the best person to judge and track the cat’s behavior and demeanor. It may only be obvious from consulting the
‘diary’ that a change in treatment is needed. 528 JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE always easy to divide and therefore delivering a small dose may be problematic and inaccu- rate. Intact tablets will provide a different dose to cats of different weights, which may not be a problem when the drug is licensed for a dose range, as for example robenacoxib, but may be a problem if a very precise target dose is required. Repeat subcutaneous injections may be another option in some cats and with some owners, although no NSAIDs are cur- rently licensed for long-term use by this route. Dosing – switching drugs There is little objective data available on the best way to transition therapy from one NSAID to another, and feline-specific infor- mation is lacking. There is concern about changing from aspirin to another NSAID in other species due to COX-2 dependent adap- tive mechanisms that may occur during thera- py.38,61 However, there is uncertainty about the need for or timing of any ‘washout’ period with other NSAIDs.38,61 S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs Dosing accuracy Panel recommendations Liquid formulations will provide for the most accurate dosing and dose adjustment of NSAIDs in cats; and manufacturers are encouraged to explore this route of delivery. The use of a dedicated and clearly marked syringe for administration of the liquid (Fig 8) should be encouraged to prevent accidental administration of excess drug when it is administered directly from a storage container. Switching between NSAIDs Panel recommendations As a precaution, a ‘washout’ period of approximately 7–10 days should be used when switching from aspirin to another NSAID. A sensible precaution may be to allow a washout period of 3–5 days when switching between other NSAIDs, and potentially longer if the previous NSAID had a
prolonged half-life. Additional adjuvant therapy with other analgesics should be considered if required during this time. FIG 8 Use of a dedicated dosing syringe is advisable A key feature of chronic pain assessment is owner involvement and observation. S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE529 NSAIDs and concomitant disease Renal disease Prostaglandins play an important role in mammalian renal physiology, helping to autoregulate vascular tone, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renin production and sodium/water balance. When renal hemo - dynamics are normal, prostaglandins appear to have a minimal role. In keeping with this, a recent study evaluating the effect of 5-day therapy with meloxicam in healthy adult cats showed no alteration in GFR based on iohexol clearance studies,74 and similarly in healthy cats undergoing anesthesia there is evidence of its safety when standard care is taken to avoid hypovolemia and hypotension.5 Under conditions of low effective renal blood flow, however, prostaglandins become crucial in maintaining renal function and GFR. Prostaglandin inhibition by NSAIDs may reduce renal blood flow and GFR and can result in the potential complication of acute kidney failure (AKF) in humans.75 NSAID COX selectivity** Formulation Dose Route Frequency Licensing indications Duration Carprofen COX-2 preferential Injection, 50 mg/ml 4 mg/kg (= 0.08 ml/kg) SC, IV Once Postsurgical pain Once only Ketoprofen None Injection, 10 mg/ml 2 mg/kg (= 0.2 ml/kg) SC q24h Relief of acute pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal and other painful disorders Up to 3 days Tablets, 5 mg 1 mg/kg (= 1 tablet/5 kg) PO q24h Up to 5 days, ± can use injection instead on day 1 Meloxicam COX-2 preferential Injection, 5 mg/ml 0.3 mg/kg (= 0.06 ml/kg) SC Once Postoperative analgesia following ovariohysterectomy and minor soft tissue surgery Once only Injection, 2 mg/ml 0.2

L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs Both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes appear to be important in maintaining renal function, but their relative importance and physiologi- cal role may differ between species;56,74 for example, a recent immunohistochemistry study demonstrated greater COX-2 expres- sion in the kidneys of dogs with chronic renal disease than in cats.55 These observations sug- gest that the propensity for NSAIDs to cause AKF may vary between species. In humans, the risk of AKF is regarded as low, and can occur with both non-selective and COX-2 selective NSAIDs, although the risk may vary between individual agents.50,75–79 In general, the risks for NSAID-induced AKF in humans are higher with conditions causing renal hypoperfusion (eg, dehydration, hypovol - emia, congestive heart failure), with old age (occult renal disease) and pre-existing renal disease, with concomitant drug therapy (eg, diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs]) and with higher doses of NSAIDs. The resultant AKF is usually reversible, provided it is detected in time.50,63,76,77,79–81 The use of NSAIDs also car- ries a small risk of inducing hyperkalemia in human patients, which is higher in those with existing renal disease and those on potassium supplements.50,57,75 In human medicine, the role of NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is much less clear. While some studies have suggested that NSAIDs may be a risk factor for developing CKD (so-called ‘analgesic nephropathy’),82–84 or in the progression of existing CKD,85 others have found no evidence of a causal associa- tion,86,87 and the difficulties in interpreting trial data have been highlighted.88 Where studies have suggested a link between CKD and NSAID use, the risk appears to be low, and may be exacerbated by heavy use of one or more NSAIDs.85,88,89 Two retrospective studies evaluated the safety of NSAIDs in a total of 76 older cats, including some cats
with stable CKD. In both studies, cats received oral meloxicam (approx- imately 0.02 mg/kg/day) on a long-term basis for osteoarthritis. One study included three cats with International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) stage 3 CKD90 and an addition- al 10 cats without CKD that had serum creati- nine concentrations monitored,13 and the other included 22 cats with IRIS stage 1–3 CKD.14 Neither study showed any significant difference in the development or progression of renal dysfunction in treated cats, compared with age- and disease-matched controls, over an average period of 6 months13 or more than 1 year.14 Another study evaluated 73 cats that received oral piroxicam at an average dose of 0.2–0.3 mg/kg/day for between 1 and 38 months. In that study, no significant changes were seen in serum renal or hepatic param - eters within the first month of therapy in 43 cats that had follow-up samples collected.91 During prolonged therapy, five cases of renal insufficiency were detected in 58 cats receiv- Renal disease Panel recommendations Based on data from cats and other species, the risk of AKF developing during appropriate therapeutic NSAID use in cats is low and not abrogated by the use of COX-selective agents. Monitoring serum renal analytes and urine parameters before and after commencement of NSAID therapy is highly recommended as a precaution, in an attempt to recognize AKF at an early stage should it occur (see section on monitoring). Risk factors for renal toxicity in humans are presumed to apply to cats. Where an increased risk of renal toxicity is anticipated the lowest effective dose should always be administered (which may be facilitated by the use of adjuvant analgesic therapy) and increased monitoring is prudent. NSAIDs should be administered with food, and therapy withheld if food is not eaten – see recommendations for GI disease. In
cats predisposed to dehydration, such as with CKD, using a wet rather than dry diet is a sensible precaution to optimize water intake. Specific risk factors, such as dehydration and hypovolemia, should always be addressed before therapy is administered, and if analgesia is required in the interim period an alternative such as an opioid can be utilized. Care should be taken to ensure good renal perfusion is also maintained if anesthesia is required during therapy. Current data suggest that at least some NSAIDs can be used safely in cats with stable CKD at judicious doses, and that this should not be a reason for withholding analgesic therapy when it is indicated. Further data, particularly in cats with advanced renal disease, would be valuable and such pharmacovigilance studies are vital. The combination of cardiac disease and renal disease is problematic – care is urged with the use of NSAIDs in this situation due to the increased risks of AKF. The exploration of analgesic options other than NSAIDs may be prudent, but the potential risks of exacerbating these diseases should not restrict the use of analgesic therapy where it is needed. As there is a risk of hyperkalemia developing during NSAID therapy in other species, especially in the face of renal failure or potassium supplementation, potassium monitoring is recommended during therapy. JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE531 S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs ing piroxicam, but as other therapies were being received, as the cats had underlying neoplasia, and as they were an older popula- tion without any controls, it was impossible to know if any of these were related directly to piroxicam therapy.91 It has been demonstrated that cats with CKD have higher circulating levels of gastrin92 and, as such, these cats may be at increased risk
of GI adverse effects when NSAIDs are used. Gastrointestinal disease Because of the physiological role of COX in maintaining the normal gastric mucosal barri- er, upper GI bleeding has been the most common serious complication associated with NSAID use in humans. Indeed, the GI tract has been considered the major site for NSAID toxicity in both humans and animals, includ- ing cats.13,16,21,48,57,93 In one study of the long-term use of piroxicam in 73 cats with neoplasia,91 vomiting was the most common- ly reported adverse effect (occurring in 16% in the first month), although there was evidence that other therapies (eg, chemotherapeutic agents) contributed to the reported preva- lence. During long-term use of oral meloxi- cam at a dose of 0.1 mg/cat, vomiting was reported in 2/46 cats (4%).14 Direct topical injury to the GI mucosa may also occur and contribute to adverse GI effects.38,59 Although studies in cats are lacking, in humans and other species, COX-1 has a major role in main- taining the mucosal integrity. However, COX- 2 expression is also thought to be important, especially for repair of injured mucosa.48,49,94,95 Factors that have been recognized as increasing the risks of GI adverse events in humans include higher doses of NSAIDs, the specific NSAID used, increased age, previous NSAID-associated GI disease, liver disease, pre-existing GI ulcers, and concurrent anti - coagulant or glucocorticoid use.57,59,63,77 Some of these risk factors have also been noted in dogs.38 In humans, the two main strategies to prevent GI adverse events with NSAIDs are to use COX-1 sparing drugs, and/or a combina- tion of an NSAID and a mucosal protectant such as a prostaglandin analogue (eg, miso- prostol) or a proton-pump inhibitor (eg, omeprazole).49,57,59,62,63,77 In cats, NSAID-asso- ciated gastric and intestinal ulceration and perforation is recognized and, in the current absence of species-specific studies,
data from humans are considered relevant.56 Cardiovascular disease Inhibition of COX activity by NSAIDs can have a number of potential adverse cardiovas- cular effects in humans. These are uncommon or rare, but include occasional exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) and/or hyper- tension due to water and salt retention mediat- ed by COX-1 and COX-2 suppression in the kidneys; reduced platelet aggregation and bleeding as a result of inhibition of COX-1 mediated platelet thromboxane production; and thromboembolic disease due to inhibition of COX-2 mediated endothelial prostacyclin production.77,96–98 While ex vivo inhibition of platelet thromboxane has been demonstrated for a number of NSAIDs in cats, studies have not been able to demonstrate a clinically ben eficial effect in preventing thromboembolic disease, or in promoting unwanted bleed- ing.56,99 Currently, there are no data on the potential effects of NSAID therapy on blood pressure or CHF in cats, or on whether COX-2 selective agents may have a prothrombotic effect in certain individuals, such as those with a propensity to develop thromboembolism. Gastrointestinal disease Panel recommendations It is assumed that, as in other species, COX-1 sparing NSAIDs may have a better safety profile than non-selective agents. As GI pain and discomfort may be difficult to detect clinically, the panel recommend the routine use of COX-1 sparing NSAIDs for long-term therapy in cats. NSAIDs should routinely be given with, or after, food in cats. Inappetence or anorexia may be an early sign of adverse GI events; hence withholding therapy in an inappetent patient is prudent. Furthermore, inappetent or anorexic cats are far more likely to become dehydrated, which would increase the risks of renal adverse events if therapy were to be continued. Cardiovascular disease Panel recommendations The risks of NSAID therapy in feline cardiovascular disease are unknown. The panel recommend that, based on human studies,
hypertensive cats receiving NSAID therapy should have their blood pressure monitored regularly. Patients with congestive heart failure should also be monitored carefully, and the NSAID use should be titrated to the lowest effective dose. Given the relatively high prevalence of thromboembolic disease in cats, whether long-term use of highly selective COX-2 inhibitors might increase this risk, as has been recognized in humans, deserves further investigation. 532 JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs Liver disease In humans, NSAID-induced hepatotoxicity is an uncommon or rare event. It is regarded as an idiosyncratic reaction mediated by hyper- sensitivity or a metabolic aberration, possibly as a result of genetic polymorphism, although with salicylates it has a predictable dose- dependent occurrence.77,100,101 The risk of this may be higher in patients receiving other potentially hepatotoxic drugs and varies between different NSAIDs, with toxicity usu- ally developing within the first 6–12 weeks of therapy.100–102 Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity has also been reported in dogs receiving NSAIDs.103 Severe hepatotoxicity following clinical use of NSAIDs has not been reported in cats, although this may simply reflect the lower prevalence of NSAID prescribing in this species.56 Although NSAIDs are metabolized by the liver, pre-existing liver disease does not appear to predispose to NSAID-induced hepatotoxicity.38 As drug metabolizing path- ways are often well preserved in liver disease, withholding NSAID therapy in such patients may not necessarily be required without evidence of significant liver dysfunction,38 although reducing doses in severe/advanced liver disease is recommended in humans.104 In humans, pre-existing advanced liver disease may be a risk factor for NSAID-associated renal and GI adverse events.63,81 NSAIDs and concomitant drug therapy Glucocorticoids Concomitant use of glucocorticoids and NSAIDs carries a well-characterized increased risk for adverse GI events in humans and dogs,38,56 with an estimated 2- to
15-fold greater risk for peptic ulcer disease in humans.59,63 Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics The use of ACEIs (and/or angiotensin recep- tor antagonists) and/or diuretics along with an NSAID carries a well-recognized risk for development of acute NSAID-associated renal adverse events in humans,63,75,81,105 and there is evidence of a higher risk when all three drugs are used together.105 Both ACEIs and NSAIDs may individually result in altered renal hemodynamics and reduced GFR, thus together the risk may be compounded, and the use of diuretics may lead to volume depletion and a greater renal dependence on prostaglandins to maintain GFR.105 Anticoagulants Although COX-1 inhibiting NSAIDs may sup- press platelet thromboxane production and reduce platelet aggregation, clinically signifi- cant bleeding as a result of this is rare in humans and, to date, has not been reported in cats.56,61,63 However, NSAIDs may appreciably potentiate the effect of warfarin, and other highly protein-bound drugs, through compet- itive protein binding63 and the use of these drugs together should be avoided. Liver disease Panel recommendations Due to the rare potential for NSAIDs to cause hepatotoxicity in other species, routine biochemical monitoring, including liver enzymes, of cats receiving long-term NSAID therapy is recommended. Dose-reduction (titration) should be considered in cats with pre-existing liver disease. In the presence of severe liver dysfunction (eg, as evidenced by moderate to severely elevated bile acids), and/or hypoalbuminemia (of any cause), NSAIDs should be used with extreme caution, if at all. Concurrent drug therapy Panel recommendations The panel recommend that concurrent use of NSAIDs and glucocorticoids should be avoided whenever possible. For short-acting glucocorticoids, a ‘washout’ period of around 5 days may be appropriate before starting an NSAID,61 but longer times should be given when long-acting steroids have been used. Because NSAIDs are highly protein-bound and have the potential to displace
other protein-bound drugs, concurrent use of protein-bound drugs with a low margin of safety, such as warfarin, digoxin, anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital, and chemotherapeutic agents, should be pursued with great care, if at all. Based on data from other species, it is likely that the concomitant use of ACEIs and/or diuretics with NSAIDs will increase the risk of renal adverse effects. Appropriate care is needed if using such combinations, with increased monitoring and the use of the lowest effective NSAID dose. The use of analgesics such as opioids should be explored as alternatives to NSAIDs, or to help minimize the dose of NSAIDs required. JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE533 S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs Monitoring cats receiving long-term NSAID therapy Adverse drug events (ADEs) related to NSAID use most commonly affect the GI system, liver, kidneys and platelet function, but lessons learned from the long-term use of these agents in dogs suggest that this class of drug is often used inappropriately and without screening and monitoring.106 While the need for, and benefit of, NSAID therapy in many situations is clear, screening and monitoring is important for the clinician, owner and patient, to help minimize the like - lihood of ADEs occurring. Until further data become available, especially from pharmaco - vigilance studies, suggested protocols for screening and monitoring cats on long-term NSAID therapy have to be based on a knowl- edge of the use of these drugs in both animals and humans, and it is important that protocols are adapted to the individual needs of the patient. Testing and screening before treatment Thorough patient evaluation before commenc- ing therapy is crucial, with a view to identify- ing concurrent conditions or therapies that may impact on NSAID administration, and allowing informed client consent to be
obtained. Screening during treatment In dogs, most NSAID-related ADEs occur between 14 and 30 days (range 3–90) after the start of treatment.107 However, it is recognized that the time for an ADE to develop is extreme- ly variable, probably being dependent on the individual drug, the dose and the individual patient. In humans, hepatotoxicity is usually reported within the first 6 months of therapy, with more than 60% of cases reported in the first 3 months,102 whereas acute renal failure is usual- ly reported early, often within the first few days or weeks of commencing drug administration.78 Based on appropriate use of NSAIDs in other species, the prevalence of ADEs is low in healthy patients. However, the frequency of certain ADEs increases in some patient groups, and these can therefore be classified Screening before therapy Panel recommendations A thorough history and physical examination is mandatory in all cats prior to commencement of NSAID therapy, paying particular attention to conditions and therapies that may impact on NSAID therapy. Wherever possible this should include blood pressure measurement (Fig 9). Ideally, the physical examination should be accompanied by laboratory testing. Laboratory evaluation should focus on the renal and hepatic systems, along with plasma proteins and hematocrit (see Table 2). The latter parameters may be surrogate markers of GI bleeding and/or mucosal damage. This aids in identifying potential problems and establishes a baseline for later comparison. Abnormalities identified in the clinical examination and on laboratory testing do not necessarily preclude the use of NSAIDs, but the risks and benefits of embarking on therapy must be discussed with the owner, and concurrent diseases may affect subsequent monitoring recommendations.

This approach enables treatment and monitoring plans to be adjusted according to perceived risks.57,59,60,62,63,81 Critically, ADEs are typically reversible with prompt recognition and inter- vention. Categorizing patients as having a higher or lower risk of ADEs has clear benefits and should be equally applicable to cats, although at present this has to be based large- ly on knowledge of ADEs in other species, due to the lack of feline-specific data. Classification of patients Panel recommendations Clinical recognition of patients that may have an increased risk of an ADE relating to NSAID therapy is important – not necessar- ily to avoid therapy, but to encourage more cautious dosing and increased relevant monitoring. Based primarily on experience in human medicine, the panel cautiously suggest that more vigilant monitoring may be required in the following situations: An increased risk of renal ADEs may be anticipated in cats with functional volume depletion (renal hypoperfusion, including that associated with hypotension during anesthesia); older cats (eg, >8–10 years of age); cats with concurrent cardiovascular, renal or hepatic disease; and cats receiving concurrent therapy with ACEIs, diuretics and β-blockers. As in humans, there may be a greater risk of NSAID-induced hyperkalemia in patients receiving potassium supplements. An increased risk
of GI ADEs may be anticipated in cats that are older; have had a previous history of NSAID-induced GI signs; have renal disease; are receiving glucocorticoid or anticoagulant therapy; have a history of GI disease; or have concurrent liver or other serious disease. An increased risk of hepatic ADEs may be anticipated in cats that are older; have renal disease; or are receiving multiple drug therapies. An increased risk of cardiovascular ADEs may be anticipated in cats that are older; have hypertension; or have pre-existing renal or cardiac disease. Particular care should be taken with unstable disease such as congestive heart failure or thromboembolic disease. The panel recommend that, when NSAIDs are used in patients with perceived higher risks of developing ADEs, greater care is taken, efforts are made to use the lowest effective dose, and increased monitoring is undertaken (see Table 2). Monitoring during therapy Panel recommendations Monitoring should take place routinely while cats are on NSAID therapy (Table 2), but the panel recognize that the extent of monitoring will be affected by many factors, including the presumed risk for the individual patient, financial constraints and owner compliance. Furthermore, multiple visits to the veterinary clinic can be stressful for some cats. Any recommendations have to be adjusted to individual situations. Involvement of owners in monitoring therapy is crucial. Owners need to be made aware of signs that should prompt cessation of therapy and/or the need for veterinary advice. Ideally a client leaflet, such as the one that accompanies these guidelines (Fig 10), or one supplied by the drug manufacturer, should be used to reinforce such information. To reduce the potential for ADEs, the panel suggest that NSAID therapy is always given with or after food. If the cat does not eat then therapy should be withheld. An initial reassessment
of all cats is recommended after the first 5–7 days of therapy, and sooner if there is concern. Although rare, acute renal failure can be life threatening and can be seen within the first few days of therapy. In some cases a telephone conversation with the owner may suffice. A routine re-evaluation of all cats (Table 2) is recommended after the first 2–4 weeks of NSAID therapy. Thereafter, the frequency of re-evaluation should be based on perceived risks and patient characteristics. For ‘lower risk’ patients, the panel recommend that a re-evaluation (Table 2) should generally take place at least every 6 months. For ‘higher risk’ patients, the panel recommend that re-evaluation (Table 2) should generally take place every 2–6 months, depending on the perceived risks. The potential risk of ADEs is a dynamic process, and at each visit the veterinarian should reassess the patient status based on the history, physical examination ± laboratory data and determine the most appropriate ongoing monitoring. Adverse drug effects are typically reversible with prompt recognition and intervention. JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE535 S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs Pain medication (NSAIDs) and your cat A ‘painkiller’ known as a ‘non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug’ (or NSAID) has been prescribed for your cat. These drugs are commonly used in humans and animals to help relieve pain, fever and inflammation – most commonly associated with degenerative joint disease (arthritis). Controlling your cat’s pain is crucial for its welfare. Many cats greatly benefit from these drugs, having better mobility, less pain, increased appetite and an improved quality of life. Degenerative joint disease (DJD) in cats Degenerative joint disease is common, especially in older cats. As with other conditions, cats may mask the signs of this disease. Problems and behavior changes in cats with DJD include:
➡Decreased activity – eg, sleeping more, not moving around as much, playing or hunting less ➡Decreased mobility – eg, reduced willingness to jump, not jumping as high, difficulty using the litter tray, stiffness, and sometimes obvious lameness ➡Decreased grooming – reduced time or difficulty grooming, a poor coat, overgrown claws ➡Altered personality – less keen to interact with people or pets, seeking solitude, ʻgrumpierʼ ➡Other signs – may include aggression or vocalization when touched and loss of appetite Understanding these changes helps alert you and your vet to the possible existence of pain and DJD, and will help you monitor whether therapy is helpful or not. Are NSAIDs safe in cats? NSAIDs play a vital role in therapy for many cats, but differences between cats and other animals mean you should only ever use a drug that has been specifically prescribed for your cat by your veterinarian. Many human drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen and paracetamol/acetaminophen can be highly toxic to cats – administering these is life-threatening. Adverse effects can be seen with NSAIDs, just as with all drugs. Some patients may be at increased risk of adverse effects (eg, older cats and cats with certain other diseases). Your veterinarian may then recommend increased monitoring and careful adjustment of therapy to find the lowest effective dose of the drug for your cat.

The leaflet may be downloaded from www.isfm.net/toolbox and www.catvets.com/professionals/guidelines/publications Safety first: If you are in any doubt, STOP the medication and TALK to your veterinarian ISFM AND AAFP STRATEGIC PARTNERS IN FELINE HEALTH AND WELFARE TOGETHER IMPROVING CATS’ LIVES WORLDWIDE What adverse effects should I look out for? Licensed NSAIDs have been shown to be safe for use in cats. However, adverse effects can still occur. Most are
mild, but some can be serious – as in other species they may involve the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, cardiovascular system or liver. Adverse effects may lead to a number of signs including: ➡Loss of appetite ➡Nausea or vomiting ➡Lethargy and dullness/depression ➡Altered thirst and/or urination ➡Diarrhea and/or black-colored feces ➡Yellowing of the skin, gums, or whites of the eyes What do I need to know? ✔Make sure you understand how to administer the drug, how much to give, how frequently and for how long. If you are unsure, ask your veterinarian. ✔Always give the medication with or after food. Your vet may suggest feeding canned rather than dry food to help encourage good fluid intake, as maintaining a good fluid intake is important. ✔If your cat does not eat DO NOT give the medication. Contact your veterinarian. ✔Talk to your veterinarian about what monitoring should be done to safeguard your cat – how frequently your cat should be re-examined, what blood and urine tests should be done, and how frequently these should be done. ✔Never give your cat any other medication at the same time without first asking your veterinarian. ✔If at any stage you have concerns, or see any potential adverse effects, STOP giving the medication and contact your veterinarian immediately. www.isfm.net www.catvets.com Adverse events and adverse event reporting (pharmacovigilance) If ADEs are encountered or undesirable effects are seen, these should be managed as appro- priate. If adverse GI events are observed, NSAID therapy should be withheld, and appropriate supportive therapy introduced, until any mucosal lesions have healed. If therapy is re-instituted, it should be done so at the lowest effective dose with consideration given to the concomitant use of omeprazole (0.7–1.0 mg/kg PO q24h) or misoprostol (5.0 µg/kg PO q8h),99,108 and/or a different NSAID where licensing permits. Hepatotoxicity
or acute renal failure are usu- ally reversible in other species on drug with- drawal and appropriate supportive therapy, providing they are detected early enough – this emphasizes the importance of patient monitor- ing and of ensuring clients are involved in this process. In humans, it is recommended that a three-fold increase in ALT should lead to cessa- tion of NSAID therapy. Milder increases may prompt more attentive monitoring, with further investigations being warranted if the ALT fails to return to baseline concentrations.57 Re-institution of alternative NSAID therapy after hepatotoxicity or acute renal failure should be done very cautiously. Increases in blood pressure have been documented in other species with NSAID therapy, and this should be monitored in cats – antihypertensive thera- py or more intense antihypertensive therapy should be used as appropriate. All ADEs should be reported to the relevant pharmaceutical company and regulatory board to help the patient and enable accurate collation of information so that we can learn more about when and why they occur.

The panel believe that these drugs have a major role to play in the management of chronic pain in cats, but at present only limited feline-specific data are available. To date, published studies of the medium- to long-term use of the COX-1 sparing drug meloxicam in older cats and cats with chronic kidney disease provide encouraging data that these drugs can be used safely and should be used to relieve pain when needed. While further data are needed, and
would undoubtedly lead to refinement of the guidelines presented here, the panel hope that these recommendations will encourage rational and safe long-term use of NSAIDs in cats, thereby improving patients’ quality of life in the face of painful disease conditions. SUMMARY POINTS Addendum To date, several of the drugs mentioned in these consensus guidelines are not licensed for use in cats in the USA, including long-term use of meloxicam. Informed owner consent is an important guiding principle when making decisions on patient care and a signed waiver is recommended when using drugs in ways that are not specifically licensed.

In the absence of medical intervention, many cats with DJD suffer pain and discomfort for years, greatly affecting their quality of life and the human/feline bond. It is vital that examina- tions of the older feline patient should specifi- cally address whether DJD is present, through history
and physical examination and, where necessary, radiology and therapeutic trials. Control of bodyweight, exercise and environ- mental modifications may help cats with DJD, as may other medical therapies. However, the dramatic responses reported to NSAIDs13,21,23 indicate that there is a huge scope for safe, effective long-term NSAID therapy in the large cohort of aged cats with DJD (Fig 3). to 6 days of therapy in cats (see Table 1, page 529). There is little doubt that others will become licensed for long-term use in the future, due to the recognition of the need and value for such NSAID therapy in this species.10,11,13–15,18 Clinicians are aware of their duty to promote animal welfare and relieve suffering, but are also often reminded of Hippocrates’ advice to ‘first do no harm’. This is often rightly used to question whether an intervention will actually do more harm than good, and to withhold that intervention when doubts exist. However, we need also to recognise that withholding treat- ments such as analgesics can sometimes cause the greater harm, because we are no longer addressing the pain and suffering the animal is enduring. In drawing up these guidelines, the international panel of experts’ purpose has been to review the current literature on long- term NSAID use in cats, and to provide practi- cal guidance on their use. The overarching aim is to encourage more widespread and appro- priate NSAID therapy, when cats will benefit from the use of these drugs. However, most of our knowledge of therapeutic mechanisms or adverse drug reactions is extrapolated from work in other species, as there is a paucity of published data relating to cats. Common causes of chronic pain and inflammation in cats One of the difficulties in managing pain in cats is its initial recognition. It is important, therefore, to
be aware of common causes of pain and to have a high index of suspicion for signs and behav- iours potentially related to pain. If something is painful to us, it is likely to be painful to a cat. Degenerative joint disease The most common cause of chronic feline pain is thought to be DJD, and this has been the sub- ject of a number of important studies in the past 10 years.11,15,16,18–24 From these studies, it is clear that DJD is very common, with radio graphic changes affecting up to 60–90% of cats (Figs 1 and 2),18,24 that it affects both the spine and the appendicular joints, and that it occurs especial- ly commonly in older patients.18,24 The hips, stifle, shoulder, elbow, tarsus and spine are the most common sites affected, although other joints can also be involved. Studies based on radiographic findings have limitations, though, as the changes observed do not necessarily cor- respond to clinical disease, or the severity of clinical disease and pain. Nevertheless, where 522 JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs Pain delays recovery, impacts negatively on a patient’s wellbeing, and disturbs the bond with its owner and also the veterinary team.

Other diseases
There are many other feline diseases where control of protracted inflammation and pain is important. These include various cancers (Fig 4a), particularly where definitive treatment is not possible, or in some cases for the anti - neoplastic effect NSAIDs may offer.25–28 Other common conditions associated with chronic pain where NSAIDs may form part of therapy include trauma, lymphoplasmacytic gingivo - stomatitis (Fig 5),29 idiopathic cystitis,30,31 skin disease and uveitis (Fig 6). In the last, both topical and/or systemic NSAID therapy may be valuable.32 Through their antipyretic effect, control of fever with NSAIDs may also be valuable in some situations. A short therapeu- tic trial of an NSAID without a definitive diag- nosis may sometimes be appropriate, using the response to treatment as a guide to diag- nosis and further therapy. Informed client consent and close monitoring of the patient is mandatory, especially in such cases. a FIG 4 Transitional carcinoma of the bladder (a) and multifocal osteomyelitic bone lesions (b) in two feline patients.

They exert these effects mostly through inhibiting the production of prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) by the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) and 5-lipoxy-
genase (5-LOX) enzymes, respectively.33–35 Most NSAIDs primarily inhibit the activity of COX enzymes. Although some also inhibit LOX enzymes, for currently licensed feline drugs this is generally short-lived in compari- son with COX inhibition, and evidence of additional clinical efficacy from this is lacking. More effective dual COX/LOX inhibitors may become available in the future.36–38 Two distinct COX isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) have been identified as being respon- sible for the production of prostaglandins (Fig 7).35 A third isoform has also been identi- fied, initially known as COX-3, now described as a splice-variant of COX-1, which seems to have a role in the central control of pain.38 Phospholipase A2 is the rate-limiting enzyme that initiates the COX pathway by liberating arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane-bound phospholipids. Both COX isoforms are then responsible for converting AA to PGG2 and PGH2 via identical enzymatic reactions. Following these initial steps, PGH2 functions as an intermediate substrate for the biosyn - thesis, by specific synthases and isomerases, of prostaglandins, prostacyclin and throm - boxanes. COX-1 converts AA to a range of mol ecules, including thromboxanes (TX), such as thromboxane A2 (TXA2), and prostaglandins, such as PGD2, PGE2 and PGF2, and prostacyclin (PGI2). COX-2 activity pro- duces a narrower spectrum of prostaglandins, specifically PGE2, and prostacyclin. The prostaglandins play a major role in many aspects of normal physiology, including vascular homeostasis, gastroprotection, renal development and blood flow, blood clotting, reproduction, bone metabolism, wound heal- ing, nerve development and growth, and immune responses. They are also involved in pathophysiological processes, including pain and inflammation, and cancer progression. However, much of our knowledge is extrapo- lated from other species, as there is a paucity of feline-specific data. Expression of COX enzymes Both COX-1 and COX-2 are enzymes that are constitutively expressed (normally present in tissues and at
fairly constant concentrations), as well as induced (appear and/or increase in concentration in response to an inciting factor, often associated with inflammation). COX-1 is considered as predominantly constitutive, being expressed in almost all tissues, and involved in the production of prostaglandins responsible for ‘house-keeping’ functions, such as the cytoprotective effects in the gastric mucosa, normal platelet function and mainte- nance of renal perfusion.39 Constitutive expression of COX-2 appears to be more FIG 7 Overview of the role of COX and LOX in prostanoid production Arachidonic acid 5-HPETE PGG2 PGG2 PGH2 PGD2 PGE2 PGI2 LTB4 LTC4 LTD4 LTE4 PGF2 PGE2 PGI2 TXA2 PGH2 LTA4 Phospholipase A2 Phospholipid cell membrane PGH2 synthases PGH2 synthases COX-1 COX-1 COX-2 COX-2 LOX LOX at University of Bristol on June 24, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE525 restricted,39,40 although it is present, along with COX-1, in the central nervous system, kidney, vascular endothelium, reproductive tract and gastrointestinal (GI) tract – sites where COX-2 activity contributes to homeo- static functions.35,41 It appears that COX-2 has an important role in healing damaged mucosa in the GI tract, and although COX-2 has been shown to be constitutively expressed in the canine GI tract,42,43 informa- tion on cats is lacking. While COX-1 is the predominant constitu- tively produced enzyme, COX-2 is predom- inantly inducible and its production is dra- matically upregulated during inflammation, in which it plays a central role.44 The expres- sion of COX-2 may also be upregulated in certain neoplasms, and in cats variable expression has been reported in transitional cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, mammary carcinomas and pancreatic carci- nomas.25–28,45–47 However, just as COX-2 has some constitutive expression, COX-1 expression also has a role to play in the inflammatory response.39,40 COX and LOX
selectivity, and NSAID adverse effects Inhibition of COX-1, the enzyme predomi- nantly associated with homeostatic func- tions, is reported to be the cause of most NSAID-induced side effects such as gastric ulcers and blood dyscrasias. In an attempt to avoid this, NSAIDs with a greater propensi- ty to suppress COX-2 than COX-1, so-called ‘COX-2 preferential’ (or ‘COX-1 sparing’) NSAIDs, have been developed. Drugs that have negligible effect on COX-1 have been termed ‘COX-2 selective’ rather than ‘prefer- ential’, although there is no recognised pre- cise definition of these terms.48 However, it rapidly became evident from human studies that COX-2 preferential or selective NSAIDs, while reducing some of the side effects classically associated with COX-1 inhibition, still caused adverse events such as acute renal failure, thromboembolic disease and gastric ulceration,49,50 consistent with a physiological role for COX-2 in a number of tissues. For example, both COX-1 and COX-2 are expressed in mam- malian kidneys. They are found within dif- ferent cells of the kidney (macula densa, cor- tical ascending tubule, medullary interstitial cells), and play different roles, but both are important to preserve renal function during hypovolaemia.50 Additionally, the inhibition of COX has been postulated to be associated with an increase in LOX activity, which can result in adverse effects on the GI mucosa. Furthermore, it has been suggested that dual inhibitors may be associated with fewer GI adverse effects than COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors. Although the COX/LOX selectivity of an NSAID may be important, this does not negate all potential side effects, and indeed evaluation of COX/LOX selectivity is not the only factor to consider when trying to predict the safety of an NSAID. There are several other issues to consider. Firstly, the risks of adverse events can be affected by tissue concentrations of the drug – where the extracellular
fluid is of a lower pH than the intracellular fluid, ‘ion trapping’ of weakly acidic drugs, such as most NSAIDs, can occur with accumulation of the drug with- in cells (eg, the gastric mucosa).51 The extent to which this occurs will vary between drugs but this local accumulation can affect the prevalence of side effects. Secondly, differences are recognised between species in both the expression and distribution of the COX enzymes.52–55 Very little feline-specific data are available, but there could be differences in susceptibility to adverse events as a result of such differences in cats. Thirdly, there are substantial variations in the reported COX selectivity of an NSAID based on the type of in vitro assay used to measure COX-1 and COX-2 activity. These results vary depending on the species used to source the material for the assay; and, even when the assay is performed in tissue from the target species, different assays yield different results.36,38,56 Additionally, differences in metab- olism of drugs between species can result in differing selectivity. In the dog, tepoxalin is a dual inhibitor for a short period of time only; but, in the cat, tepoxalin pharmacokinetics indi- cate it is potentially a balanced COX and LOX inhibitor throughout its kinetic profile.38 Other factors also affect the risk of adverse events – for example, age. Older humans are recognised to be at greatest risk of GI ulcera- tion; and in human medicine pre-existing renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease and hepatic disease are all relative contraindica- tions for use of NSAIDs. However, manage- ment of pain in the geriatric patient becomes critical to quality of life. Therefore, careful selection of NSAIDs and their dose, and the use of adjunctive therapies (such as proton pump inhibitors to assist gastroprotection, other analgesics to modulate other parts of the pain pathway
and reduce the required NSAID dose, and fluid therapy to minimise effects of hypovolaemia), must be considered rather than simply avoiding addressing pain in both humans57–60 and veterinary species.61 Patient selection, dose titration and ongoing monitoring for the early signs of toxicity are essential.62,63 at University of Bristol on June 24, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from What does this mean for cats? Because of species differences in expression of COX enzymes and in the in vitro COX selec- tivity assays, it is imprudent to generalise results from any single study.64 With all these variables, it is not surprising that there is no simple answer to the question of whether a COX selective or a dual COX/LOX inhibitor is better, and indeed what the ‘ideal’ COX/LOX selectivity and profile of an NSAID is in the cat. It may indeed depend on the disease process and the individual being treated. Despite these caveats, and given the paucity of feline-specific data at present, we can only cautiously extrapolate knowledge based on data from other species. Practical NSAID therapy in cats Beyond the question of COX selectivity, many other factors are also important in choosing and using NSAIDs for long-term therapy in cats. Compliance Administering medication to cats can be challenging for owners, yet adequate therapy relies on good owner compliance. Along with NSAIDs, many cats will be receiving other medications and the ‘administration burden’ may be daunting for owners, leading to incon- sistent dosing. To help long-term use, a drug should ideally be highly palatable and taken voluntarily by the cat – for example, in food or as a treat – and veterinary pharmaceutical companies undertake much research into this.65 Published studies suggest meloxicam liquid is highly palatable in cats,13,16 with one study suggesting it was significantly more palatable than ketoprofen tablets.16 Other drugs
may be compounded in specific flavours that are appealing to individual cats. 526 JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs However, it is important to follow all regula- tions and compliance policies for drug com- pounding,66 which are different throughout the world, and to consider the potential effect of compounding on bioavailability and stability/ shelf-life. Additionally, owners must be consistent and remember to administer the drug. Based on the long duration of action of many NSAIDs in cats, this should be at a set time on treatment days. Creative reminder systems may help ensure cats receive medication on the correct day(s), at the correct time(s) and at the correct dose. Giving medication along with a daily food ration (which should also be done for safety) can provide a built-in reminder system for owners, and encourage owner involvement in the monitoring process. Dosing – intervals, frequency, timing and the ‘lowest effective dose’ Short-term pharmacokinetic data are available for a number of NSAIDs in cats, which form a basis for dosing intervals. While many NSAIDs are metabolised via glucuronidation in the liver, and the relative deficiency of glucuronyl transferase enzymes in cats may lead to a prolonged half-life for some of these drugs,37,56 others, such as piroxicam and meloxicam,56,67 are metabolised by oxidation. Single doses of many approved/licensed NSAIDs for acute pain in cats seem to have a duration of action of around 18–20 h.56 However, it is not known if such prolonged pharmacokinetics are necessary for appropri- ate efficacy. For example, meloxicam and robenacoxib have a serum half-life of approx- imately 24 and 2 h, respectively,68,69 yet both have been shown to be effective for daily treatment of musculoskeletal pain in cats by virtue of their European licences. COX-2 selectivity Panel recommendations
✜In keeping with other species, studies of NSAIDs in cats suggest no difference in anti-inflammatory or analgesic efficacy between COX non-selective drugs and variably COX-2 selective inhibitors. ✜It is presumed, as in other species, that using drugs with a greater COX-2 selectivity in cats will help avoid some of the potential adverse effects associated with COX-1 suppression, such as GI irritation/ulceration and platelet inhibition. However, selective COX-2 inhibition will not completely negate the possibility of adverse effects and may not confer any renoprotective effect in comparison with a non-selective inhibitor. ✜It is presumed that dual inhibition of COX and LOX may be associated with reduced GI adverse effects over COX inhibition alone. However, it is unlikely that dual inhibition will completely negate the possibility of adverse effects. at University of Bristol on June 24, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE527 S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs For most of the NSAIDs used in cats, it is not known if repeated long-term dosing alters the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the drug. In one study, the administration of flunixin daily for 7 days appeared to result in more rapid metabolism of the drug after 7 days and decreased pharmacodynamic effects,70 although the same did not appear to be evident during daily administration of meloxicam for 7 days.68 Additionally, informa- tion on the apparent efficacy of daily versus every-other-day or less frequent dosing is anecdotal, with no controlled studies yet pub- lished. Daily dosing of meloxicam at less than the labelled dose for a mean of 5.8 months was considered to be clinically effective and asso- ciated with minimal adverse effects in one non-blinded study,13 although efficacy was not measured objectively or with a validated assessment system. However, due to the inter- cat variability of
pharmacokinetics with administration of a variety of NSAIDs, it is likely that daily dosing may be appropriate for some cats, while longer intervals might be appropriate for others. Unfortunately there is no practical way to determine which cats might be ‘fast’ metabolisers and which slower. Additionally, probably as a result of their high protein-bind- ing, which may enable NSAIDs to persist in inflamed tissue sites for longer than in plasma, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity of these drugs often persists longer than would be predicted from their serum half-life. This may enable daily dosing even for drugs with a relatively short half-life.38,69 Indeed persistence at the site of inflammation has been demonstrated in an experimental study of robenacoxib in cats.67 It is, therefore, unlikely that a set mg/kg dose and dosing schedule will work equally well for all cats; furthermore, variations in the level of pain may alter the cat’s needs over time. Very little attention has been given to the best time of day to administer NSAIDs to cats to achieve the most beneficial effect, a concept termed chronotherapy.71 Theoretically, long-term dosing may result in a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state. However, ‘peaks and troughs’ may still occur. If the peak beneficial effect on lameness occurs at say 5 h after dosing, treat- ment may be tailored to achieve maximum clinical effect when the cat is most active. The timing, therefore, may depend on a cat’s lifestyle. Alternatively, an owner may find that at ‘peak effect’ the cat is more comfortable, it rests for longer and may choose to administer the drug to promote resting and sleeping at the most suitable time for the household. Dosing – accuracy Dosing accuracy will depend on the formula- tion of the drug. Liquids are more easily measured, and can be delivered in small
volumes. Thus incremental increases or decreases in dose are potentially more readily achieved. However, differing dispensing methods can potentially result in wide varia- tions in doses. Tablets or caplets are not Dosing frequency Panel recommendations ✜To avoid potential side effects, owners should be encouraged to work on titrating to the ‘lowest effective dose’ that works for their cat, with the understanding that this may change over time. This dose may often be less than the labelled dose.13,14,21 ✜In overweight or obese cats, it is prudent to calculate initial doses for NSAIDs according to their lean or ideal bodyweight. ✜When attempting to reduce the overall dose of an NSAID, it would seem prudent to reduce the label dose but maintain the label frequency, where possible. ✜The panel recognise that intermittent therapy, for example 2–3 times weekly rather than daily, is better than no therapy at all, and anecdotally appears efficacious in some cats. However, there may be a risk of significant periods of time when no effective therapy, or suboptimal therapy, is being achieved. ✜Intermittent drug withdrawal, a reduced frequency of dosing, or a reduction of the dose may all help owners to assess drug efficacy. ✜The panel see little rationale for pulse therapy with NSAIDs unless the underlying disease process varies sufficiently in severity that it does not require consistent analgesic/anti-inflammatory therapy. Treatment may be tailored to achieve maximum clinical effect when the cat is most active. Alternatively, an owner may choose to administer the drug to promote resting and sleeping at the most suitable time for the household. at University of Bristol on June 24, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from Monitoring efficacy There is no validated assessment tool for acute or chronic feline pain, although studies are ongoing.72 In studies evaluating the efficacy of NSAIDs in cats with musculoskeletal pain,
improved mobility, and in particular the will- ingness to jump and the height of the jump, have been the most obvious signs of improve- ment,13,21 and another study found increases in mobility with administration of an NSAID.15 One key feature of chronic pain assessment is owner involvement and obser- vation, especially as pain may manifest in different ways in individual cats.56,73 It has been postulated that four behavioural domains – mobility, activity, grooming and temperament – are particularly useful to both clinicians and owners in assessing chronic musculoskeletal pain and monitoring the response to therapy.23 When treating animals with long-term dis- eases, an overall assessment of ‘quality of life’ may be beneficial; this includes, but is not lim- ited to, pain. An assessment tool may need to be individually designed since what is impor- tant to each patient will be different: can the cat climb trees, hunt, play with other pets in the household, and so on?15 This was the thinking behind the use of client-specific out- come measures in a recent study.15 Owners should keep a regular journal or diary of the cat’s activities, as changes in mobility and behaviour may be subtle and occur slowly. The owner is the best person to judge and track the cat’s behaviour and demeanour. It may only be obvious from consulting the ‘diary’ that a change in treatment is needed. 528 JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE always easy to divide and therefore delivering a small dose may be problematic and inaccu- rate. Intact tablets will provide a different dose to cats of different weights, which may not be a problem when the drug is licensed for a dose range, as for example robenacoxib, but may be a problem if a very precise target dose is required. Repeat subcutaneous injections may be another option in
some cats and with some owners, although no NSAIDs are cur- rently licensed for long-term use by this route. Dosing – switching drugs There is little objective data available on the best way to transition therapy from one NSAID to another, and feline-specific infor- mation is lacking. There is concern about changing from aspirin to another NSAID in other species due to COX-2 dependent adap- tive mechanisms that may occur during thera- py.38,61 However, there is uncertainty about the need for or timing of any ‘washout’ period with other NSAIDs.38,61 S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs Dosing accuracy Panel recommendations ✜Liquid formulations will provide for the most accurate dosing and dose adjustment of NSAIDs in cats; and manufacturers are encouraged to explore this route of delivery. ✜The use of a dedicated and clearly marked syringe for administration of the liquid (Fig 8) should be encouraged to prevent accidental administration of excess drug when it is administered directly from a storage container. Switching between NSAIDs Panel recommendations ✜As a precaution, a ‘washout’ period of approximately 7–10 days should be used when switching from aspirin to another NSAID. ✜A sensible precaution may be to allow a washout period of 3–5 days when switching between other NSAIDs, and potentially longer if the previous NSAID had a prolonged half-life. Additional adjuvant therapy with other analgesics should be considered if required during this time.

helping to autoregulate vascular tone, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renin production and sodium/water balance. When renal haemo - dynamics are normal, prostaglandins appear to have a minimal role. In keeping with this, a recent study evaluating the effect of 5-day therapy with meloxicam in healthy adult cats showed no alteration in GFR based on iohexol clearance studies,74 and similarly in healthy cats undergoing anaesthesia there is evidence of its safety when standard care is taken to avoid hypovolaemia and hypotension.5 Under conditions of low effective renal blood flow, however, prostaglandins become crucial in maintaining renal function and GFR. Prostaglandin inhibition by NSAIDs may reduce renal blood flow and GFR and can result in the potential complication of acute kidney failure (AKF) in humans.75 NSAID COX selectivity* Formulation Dose Route Frequency Licensing indications Duration Carprofen COX-2 preferential Injection, 50 mg/ml 4 mg/kg (= 0.08 ml/kg) SC, IV Once Postsurgical pain Once only Ketoprofen None Injection, 10 mg/ml 2 mg/kg (= 0.2 ml/kg) SC q24h Relief of acute pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal and other painful disorders Up to 3 days Tablets, 5 mg 1 mg/kg (= 1 tablet/5 kg) PO q24h Up to 5 days, ± can use injection instead on day 1 Meloxicam COX-2 preferential Injection, 5 mg/ml 0.3 mg/kg (= 0.06 ml/kg) SC Once Postoperative analgesia following ovariohysterectomy and minor soft tissue surgery Once only Injection, 2 mg/ml 0.2 mg/kg (= 0.1 ml/kg) SC Once Mild to moderate postsurgical pain Can be followed by 0.05 mg/kg q24h PO for 4 days Oral suspension, 0.5 mg/ml 0.1 mg/kg (= 0.2 ml/kg) day 1, then 0.05 mg/kg (= 0.1 ml/kg) PO q24h Inflammation and pain in chronic musculoskeletal conditions Indefinite Robenacoxib COX-2 selective Tablets, 6 mg 1 mg/kg (= 1 tablet/6 kg) PO q24h Pain and inflammation associated with musculoskeletal

for NSAIDs to cause AKF may vary between species. In humans, the risk of AKF is regarded as low, and can occur with both non-selective and COX-2 selective NSAIDs, although the risk may vary between individual agents.50,75–79 In general, the risks for NSAID-induced AKF in humans are higher with conditions causing renal hypoperfusion (eg, dehydration, hypo- volaemia, congestive heart failure), with old age (occult renal disease) and pre-existing renal disease, with concomitant drug therapy (eg, diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs]) and with higher doses of NSAIDs. The resultant AKF is usually reversible, provided it is detected in time.50,63,76,77,79–81 The use of NSAIDs also car- ries a small risk of inducing hyperkalaemia in human patients, which is higher in those with existing renal disease and those on potassium supplements.50,57,75 In human medicine, the role of NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is much less clear. While some studies have suggested that NSAIDs may be a risk factor for developing CKD (so-called ‘analgesic nephropathy’),82–84 or in the progression of existing CKD,85 others have found no evidence of a causal associa- tion,86,87 and the difficulties in interpreting trial data have been highlighted.88 Where studies have suggested a link between CKD and NSAID use, the risk appears to be low, and may be exacerbated by heavy use of one or more NSAIDs.85,88,89 Two retrospective studies evaluated the safety of NSAIDs in a total of 76 older cats, including some cats with stable CKD. In both studies, cats received oral meloxicam (approx- imately 0.02 mg/kg/day) on a long-term basis for osteoarthritis. One study included three cats with International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) stage 3 CKD90 and an addition- al 10 cats without CKD that had serum creati- nine concentrations monitored,13 and the other included 22 cats with IRIS stage 1–3 CKD.14 Neither study showed
any significant difference in the development or progression of renal dysfunction in treated cats, compared with age- and disease-matched controls, over an average period of 6 months13 or more than 1 year.14 Another study evaluated 73 cats that received oral piroxicam at an average dose of 0.2–0.3 mg/kg/day for between 1 and 38 months. In that study, no significant changes were seen in serum renal or hepatic param - eters within the first month of therapy in 43 cats that had follow-up samples collected.91 During prolonged therapy, five cases of renal insufficiency were detected in 58 cats receiv- Renal disease Panel recommendations ✜Based on data from cats and other species, the risk of AKF developing during appropriate therapeutic NSAID use in cats is low and not abrogated by the use of COX-selective agents. ✜Monitoring serum renal analytes and urine parameters before and after commencement of NSAID therapy is highly recommended as a precaution, in an attempt to recognise AKF at an early stage should it occur (see section on monitoring). ✜Risk factors for renal toxicity in humans are presumed to apply to cats. Where an increased risk of renal toxicity is anticipated the lowest effective dose should always be administered (which may be facilitated by the use of adjuvant analgesic therapy) and increased monitoring is prudent. ✜NSAIDs should be administered with food, and therapy withheld if food is not eaten – see recommendations for GI disease. In cats predisposed to dehydration, such as with CKD, using a wet rather than dry diet is a sensible precaution to optimise water intake. ✜Specific risk factors, such as dehydration and hypovolaemia, should always be addressed before therapy is administered, and if analgesia is required in the interim period an alternative such as an opioid can be utilised. Care should be taken to ensure
good renal perfusion is also maintained if anaesthesia is required during therapy. ✜Current data suggest that at least some NSAIDs can be used safely in cats with stable CKD at judicious doses, and that this should not be a reason for withholding analgesic therapy when it is indicated. Further data, particularly in cats with advanced renal disease, would be valuable and such pharmacovigilance studies are vital. ✜The combination of cardiac disease and renal disease is problematic – care is urged with the use of NSAIDs in this situation due to the increased risks of AKF. The exploration of analgesic options other than NSAIDs may be prudent, but the potential risks of exacerbating these diseases should not restrict the use of analgesic therapy where it is needed. ✜As there is a risk of hyperkalaemia developing during NSAID therapy in other species, especially in the face of renal failure or potassium supplementation, potassium monitoring is recommended during therapy. at University of Bristol on June 24, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE531 S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs ing piroxicam, but as other therapies were being received, as the cats had underlying neoplasia, and as they were an older popula- tion without any controls, it was impossible to know if any of these were related directly to piroxicam therapy.91 It has been demonstrated that cats with CKD have higher circulating levels of gastrin92 and, as such, these cats may be at increased risk of GI adverse effects when NSAIDs are used. Gastrointestinal disease Because of the physiological role of COX in maintaining the normal gastric mucosal barri- er, upper GI bleeding has been the most common serious complication associated with NSAID use in humans. Indeed, the GI tract has been considered the major site for
NSAID toxicity in both humans and animals, includ- ing cats.13,16,21,48,57,93 In one study of the long-term use of piroxicam in 73 cats with neoplasia,91 vomiting was the most common- ly reported adverse effect (occurring in 16% in the first month), although there was evidence that other therapies (eg, chemotherapeutic agents) contributed to the reported preva- lence. During long-term use of oral meloxi- cam at a dose of 0.1 mg/cat, vomiting was reported in 2/46 cats (4%).14 Direct topical injury to the GI mucosa may also occur and contribute to adverse GI effects.38,59 Although studies in cats are lacking, in humans and other species, COX-1 has a major role in main- taining the mucosal integrity. However, COX- 2 expression is also thought to be important, especially for repair of injured mucosa.48,49,94,95 Factors that have been recognised as increasing the risks of GI adverse events in humans include higher doses of NSAIDs, the specific NSAID used, increased age, previous NSAID-associated GI disease, liver disease, pre-existing GI ulcers, and concurrent anti - coagulant or glucocorticoid use.57,59,63,77 Some of these risk factors have also been noted in dogs.38 In humans, the two main strategies to prevent GI adverse events with NSAIDs are to use COX-1 sparing drugs, and/or a combina- tion of an NSAID and a mucosal protectant such as a prostaglandin analogue (eg, miso- prostol) or a proton-pump inhibitor (eg, omeprazole).49,57,59,62,63,77 In cats, NSAID-asso- ciated gastric and intestinal ulceration and perforation is recognised and, in the current absence of species-specific studies, data from humans are considered relevant.56 Cardiovascular disease Inhibition of COX activity by NSAIDs can have a number of potential adverse cardiovas- cular effects in humans. These are uncommon or rare, but include occasional exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) and/or hyper- tension due to water and salt retention mediat- ed by
COX-1 and COX-2 suppression in the kidneys; reduced platelet aggregation and bleeding as a result of inhibition of COX-1 mediated platelet thromboxane production; and thromboembolic disease due to inhibition of COX-2 mediated endothelial prostacyclin production.77,96–98 While ex vivo inhibition of platelet thromboxane has been demonstrated for a number of NSAIDs in cats, studies have not been able to demonstrate a clinically ben eficial effect in preventing thromboembolic disease, or in promoting unwanted bleed- ing.56,99 Currently, there are no data on the potential effects of NSAID therapy on blood pressure or CHF in cats, or on whether COX-2 selective agents may have a prothrombotic effect in certain individuals, such as those with a propensity to develop thromboembolism. Gastrointestinal disease Panel recommendations ✜It is assumed that, as in other species, COX-1 sparing NSAIDs may have a better safety profile than non-selective agents. As GI pain and discomfort may be difficult to detect clinically, the panel recommend the routine use of COX-1 sparing NSAIDs for long-term therapy in cats. ✜NSAIDs should routinely be given with, or after, food in cats. Inappetence or anorexia may be an early sign of adverse GI events; hence withholding therapy in an inappetent patient is prudent. Furthermore, inappetent or anorexic cats are far more likely to become dehydrated, which would increase the risks of renal adverse events if therapy were to be continued. Cardiovascular disease Panel recommendations ✜The risks of NSAID therapy in feline cardiovascular disease are unknown. ✜The panel recommend that, based on human studies, hypertensive cats receiving NSAID therapy should have their blood pressure monitored regularly. Patients with congestive heart failure should also be monitored carefully, and the NSAID use should be titrated to the lowest effective dose. ✜Given the relatively high prevalence of thromboembolic disease in cats, whether long-term use of highly selective COX-2 inhibitors
might increase this risk, as has been recognised in humans, deserves further investigation. at University of Bristol on June 24, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from 532 JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs Liver disease In humans, NSAID-induced hepatotoxicity is an uncommon or rare event. It is regarded as an idiosyncratic reaction mediated by hyper- sensitivity or a metabolic aberration, possibly as a result of genetic polymorphism, although with salicylates it has a predictable dose- dependent occurrence.77,100,101 The risk of this may be higher in patients receiving other potentially hepatotoxic drugs and varies between different NSAIDs, with toxicity usu- ally developing within the first 6–12 weeks of therapy.100–102 Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity has also been reported in dogs receiving NSAIDs.103 Severe hepatotoxicity following clinical use of NSAIDs has not been reported in cats, although this may simply reflect the lower prevalence of NSAID prescribing in this species.56 Although NSAIDs are metabolised by the liver, pre-existing liver disease does not appear to predispose to NSAID-induced hepatotoxicity.38 As drug metabolising path- ways are often well preserved in liver disease, withholding NSAID therapy in such patients may not necessarily be required without evidence of significant liver dysfunction,38 although reducing doses in severe/advanced liver disease is recommended in humans.104 In humans, pre-existing advanced liver disease may be a risk factor for NSAID-associated renal and GI adverse events.63,81 NSAIDs and concomitant drug therapy Glucocorticoids Concomitant use of glucocorticoids and NSAIDs carries a well-characterised increased risk for adverse GI events in humans and dogs,38,56 with an estimated 2- to 15-fold greater risk for peptic ulcer disease in humans.59,63 Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics The use of ACEIs (and/or angiotensin recep- tor antagonists) and/or diuretics along with an NSAID carries a well-recognised risk for development of acute NSAID-associated renal adverse
events in humans,63,75,81,105 and there is evidence of a higher risk when all three drugs are used together.105 Both ACEIs and NSAIDs may individually result in altered renal haemodynamics and reduced GFR, thus together the risk may be compounded, and the use of diuretics may lead to volume depletion and a greater renal dependence on prostaglandins to maintain GFR.105 Anticoagulants Although COX-1 inhibiting NSAIDs may sup- press platelet thromboxane production and reduce platelet aggregation, clinically signifi- cant bleeding as a result of this is rare in humans and, to date, has not been reported in cats.56,61,63 However, NSAIDs may appreciably potentiate the effect of warfarin, and other highly protein-bound drugs, through compet- itive protein binding63 and the use of these drugs together should be avoided. Liver disease Panel recommendations ✜Due to the rare potential for NSAIDs to cause hepatotoxicity in other species, routine biochemical monitoring, including liver enzymes, of cats receiving long-term NSAID therapy is recommended. ✜Dose-reduction (titration) should be considered in cats with pre-existing liver disease. In the presence of severe liver dysfunction (eg, as evidenced by moderate to severely elevated bile acids), and/or hypoalbuminaemia (of any cause), NSAIDs should be used with extreme caution, if at all. Concurrent drug therapy Panel recommendations ✜The panel recommend that concurrent use of NSAIDs and glucocorticoids should be avoided whenever possible. For short-acting glucocorticoids, a ‘washout’ period of around 5 days may be appropriate before starting an NSAID,61 but longer times should be given when long-acting steroids have been used. ✜Because NSAIDs are highly protein-bound and have the potential to displace other protein-bound drugs, concurrent use of protein-bound drugs with a low margin of safety, such as warfarin, digoxin, anticonvulsants such as phenobarbitone, and chemotherapeutic agents, should be pursued with great care, if at all. ✜Based on data from other species, it
is likely that the concomitant use of ACEIs and/or diuretics with NSAIDs will increase the risk of renal adverse effects. Appropriate care is needed if using such combinations, with increased monitoring and the use of the lowest effective NSAID dose. The use of analgesics such as opioids should be explored as alternatives to NSAIDs, or to help minimise the dose of NSAIDs required. at University of Bristol on June 24, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE533 S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs Monitoring cats receiving long-term NSAID therapy Adverse drug events (ADEs) related to NSAID use most commonly affect the GI system, liver, kidneys and platelet function, but lessons learned from the long-term use of these agents in dogs suggest that this class of drug is often used inappropriately and without screening and monitoring.106 While the need for, and benefit of, NSAID therapy in many situations is clear, screening and monitoring is important for the clinician, owner and patient, to help minimise the like - lihood of ADEs occurring. Until further data become available, especially from pharmaco - vigilance studies, suggested protocols for screening and monitoring cats on long-term NSAID therapy have to be based on a knowl- edge of the use of these drugs in both animals and humans, and it is important that protocols are adapted to the individual needs of the patient. Testing and screening before treatment Thorough patient evaluation before commenc- ing therapy is crucial, with a view to identify- ing concurrent conditions or therapies that may impact on NSAID administration, and allowing informed client consent to be obtained. Screening during treatment In dogs, most NSAID-related ADEs occur between 14 and 30 days (range 3–90) after the start of treatment.107 However, it is recognised that the time for
an ADE to develop is extreme- ly variable, probably being dependent on the individual drug, the dose and the individual patient. In humans, hepatotoxicity is usually reported within the first 6 months of therapy, with more than 60% of cases reported in the first 3 months,102 whereas acute renal failure is usual- ly reported early, often within the first few days or weeks of commencing drug administration.78 Based on appropriate use of NSAIDs in other species, the prevalence of ADEs is low in healthy patients. However, the frequency of certain ADEs increases in some patient groups, and these can therefore be classified Screening before therapy Panel recommendations ✜A thorough history and physical examination is mandatory in all cats prior to commencement of NSAID therapy, paying particular attention to conditions and therapies that may impact on NSAID therapy. Wherever possible this should include blood pressure measurement (Fig 9). ✜Ideally, the physical examination should be accompanied by laboratory testing. Laboratory evaluation should focus on the renal and hepatic systems, along with plasma proteins and haematocrit (see Table 2). The latter parameters may be surrogate markers of GI bleeding and/or mucosal damage. This aids in identifying potential problems and establishes a baseline for later comparison. ✜Abnormalities identified in the clinical examination and on laboratory testing do not necessarily preclude the use of NSAIDs, but the risks and benefits of embarking on therapy must be discussed with the owner, and concurrent diseases may affect subsequent monitoring recommendations.

This approach enables treatment and monitoring plans to be adjusted according to perceived risks.57,59,60,62,63,81 Critically, ADEs are typically reversible with prompt recognition and inter- vention. Categorising patients as having a higher or lower risk of ADEs has clear benefits and should be equally applicable to cats, although at present this has to be based large- ly on knowledge of ADEs in other species, due to the lack of feline-specific data. Classification of patients Panel recommendations Clinical recognition of patients that may have an increased risk of an ADE relating to NSAID therapy is important – not necessar- ily to avoid therapy, but to encourage more cautious dosing and increased relevant monitoring. Based primarily on experience in human medicine, the panel cautiously suggest that more vigilant monitoring may be required in the following situations: ✜An increased risk of renal ADEs may be anticipated in cats with functional volume depletion (renal hypoperfusion, including that associated with hypotension during anaesthesia); older cats (eg, >8–10 years of age); cats with concurrent cardiovascular, renal or hepatic disease; and cats receiving concurrent therapy with ACEIs, diuretics and β-blockers. As in humans, there may be a greater risk of NSAID-induced hyperkalaemia in patients receiving potassium supplements. ✜An increased risk of GI ADEs may be anticipated in cats that are older; have had a previous history of NSAID-induced GI
signs; have renal disease; are receiving glucocorticoid or anticoagulant therapy; have a history of GI disease; or have concurrent liver or other serious disease. ✜An increased risk of hepatic ADEs may be anticipated in cats that are older; have renal disease; or are receiving multiple drug therapies. ✜An increased risk of cardiovascular ADEs may be anticipated in cats that are older; have hypertension; or have pre-existing renal or cardiac disease. Particular care should be taken with unstable disease such as congestive heart failure or thromboembolic disease. ✜The panel recommend that, where NSAIDs are used in patients with perceived higher risks of developing ADEs, greater care is taken, efforts are made to use the lowest effective dose, and increased monitoring is undertaken (see Table 2). Monitoring during therapy Panel recommendations ✜Monitoring should take place routinely while cats are on NSAID therapy (Table 2), but the panel recognise that the extent of monitoring will be affected by many factors, including the presumed risk for the individual patient, financial constraints and owner compliance. Furthermore, multiple visits to the veterinary clinic can be stressful for some cats. Any recommendations have to be adjusted to individual situations. ✜Involvement of owners in monitoring therapy is crucial. Owners need to be made aware of signs that should prompt cessation of therapy and/or the need for veterinary advice. Ideally a client leaflet, such as the one that accompanies these guidelines (Fig 10), or one supplied by the drug manufacturer, should be used to reinforce such information. ✜To reduce the potential for ADEs, the panel suggest that NSAID therapy is always given with or after food. If the cat does not eat then therapy should be withheld. ✜An initial reassessment of all cats is recommended after the first 5–7 days of therapy, and sooner if there is concern. Although
rare, acute renal failure can be life threatening and can be seen within the first few days of therapy. In some cases a telephone conversation with the owner may suffice. ✜A routine re-evaluation of all cats (Table 2) is recommended after the first 2–4 weeks of NSAID therapy. Thereafter, the frequency of re-evaluation should be based on perceived risks and patient characteristics. ✜For ‘lower risk’ patients, the panel recommend that a re-evaluation (Table 2) should generally take place at least every 6 months. ✜For ‘higher risk’ patients, the panel recommend that re-evaluation (Table 2) should generally take place every 2–6 months, depending on the perceived risks. ✜The potential risk of ADEs is a dynamic process, and at each visit the veterinarian should reassess the patient status based on the history, physical examination ± laboratory data and determine the most appropriate ongoing monitoring. Adverse drug effects are typically reversible with prompt recognition and intervention. at University of Bristol on June 24, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE535 S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs Pain medication (NSAIDs) and your cat A ‘painkiller’ known as a ‘non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug’ (or NSAID) has been prescribed for your cat. These drugs are commonly used in humans and animals to help relieve pain, fever and inflammation – most commonly associated with degenerative joint disease. Controlling your cat’s pain is crucial for its welfare. Many cats greatly benefit from these drugs, having better mobility, less pain, increased appetite and an improved quality of life. Degenerative joint disease (DJD) in cats Degenerative joint disease (including osteoarthritis) is common, especially in older cats. As with other conditions, cats may mask the signs of this disease. Problems and behaviour changes in cats with DJD include: ➡Decreased activity – eg, sleeping more, not
moving around as much, playing or hunting less ➡Decreased mobility – eg, reduced willingness to jump, not jumping as high, difficulty using the litter tray, stiffness, and sometimes obvious lameness ➡Decreased grooming – reduced time or difficulty grooming, a poor coat, overgrown claws ➡Altered personality – less keen to interact with people or pets, seeking solitude, ʻgrumpierʼ ➡Other signs – may include aggression or vocalisation when touched and loss of appetite Understanding these changes helps alert you and your vet to the possible existence of pain and DJD, and will help you monitor whether therapy is helpful or not. Are NSAIDs safe in cats? NSAIDs play a vital role in therapy for many cats, but differences between cats and other animals mean you should only ever use a drug that has been specifically prescribed for your cat by your veterinarian. Many human drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen and paracetamol/acetaminophen can be highly toxic to cats – administering these is life-threatening. Adverse effects can be seen with NSAIDs, just as with all drugs. Some patients may be at increased risk of adverse effects (eg, older cats and cats with certain other diseases). Your veterinarian may then recommend increased monitoring and careful adjustment of therapy to find the lowest effective dose of the drug for your cat. FIG 10 Client leaflet advising on safe use of NSAIDs. The leaflet may be downloaded from www.isfm.net/toolbox and www.catvets.com/professionals/guidelines/publications Safety first: If you are in any doubt, STOP the medication and TALK to your veterinarian ISFM AND AAFP STRATEGIC PARTNERS IN FELINE HEALTH AND WELFARE TOGETHER IMPROVING CATS’ LIVES WORLDWIDE What adverse effects should I look out for? Licensed NSAIDs have been shown to be safe for use in cats. However, adverse effects can still occur. Most are mild, but some can be serious –
as in other species they may involve the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, cardiovascular system or liver. Adverse effects may lead to a number of signs including: ➡Loss of appetite ➡Nausea or vomiting ➡Lethargy and dullness/depression ➡Altered thirst and/or urination ➡Diarrhoea and/or black-coloured faeces ➡Yellowing of the skin, gums, or whites of the eyes What do I need to know? ✔Make sure you understand how much of the drug to give, how frequently, and for how long. If you are unsure, ask your veterinarian. ✔Always give the medication with or after food. Your vet may suggest feeding canned rather than dry food to help encourage good fluid intake, as maintaining a good fluid intake is important. ✔If your cat does not eat DO NOT give the medication. Contact your veterinarian. ✔Talk to your veterinarian about what monitoring should be done to safeguard your cat – how frequently your cat should be re-examined, what blood and urine tests should be done, and how frequently these should be done. ✔Never give your cat any other medication at the same time without first speaking to your veterinarian. ✔If at any stage you have concerns, or see any potential adverse effects, STOP giving the medication and contact your veterinarian immediately. www.isfm.net www.catvets.com Adverse events and adverse event reporting (pharmacovigilance) If ADEs are encountered or undesirable effects are seen, these should be managed as appro- priate. If adverse GI events are observed, NSAID therapy should be withheld, and appropriate supportive therapy introduced, until any mucosal lesions have healed. If therapy is re-instituted, it should be done so at the lowest effective dose with consideration given to the concomitant use of omeprazole (0.7–1.0 mg/kg PO q24h) or misoprostol (5.0 µg/kg PO q8h),99,108 and/or a different NSAID where licensing permits. Hepatotoxicity or acute renal failure are usu- ally reversible
in other species on drug with- drawal and appropriate supportive therapy, providing they are detected early enough – this emphasises the importance of patient monitor- ing and of ensuring clients are involved in this process. In humans, it is recommended that a three-fold increase in ALT should lead to cessa- tion of NSAID therapy. Milder increases may prompt more attentive monitoring, with further investigations being warranted if the ALT fails to return to baseline concentrations.57 Re-institution of alternative NSAID therapy after hepatotoxicity or acute renal failure should be done very cautiously. Increases in blood pressure have been documented in other species with NSAID therapy, and this should be monitored in cats – antihypertensive thera- py or more intense antihypertensive therapy should be used as appropriate. All ADEs should be reported to the relevant pharmaceutical company and regulatory board to help the patient and enable accurate collation of information so that we can learn more about when and why they occur.

10.1177/1098612X13476033 jfms.com Optimal pain relief is generally achieved with the simul­ taneous use of two or more different classes of analge­ sics: this is known as multimodal analgesia. In this approach, each analgesic acts at different levels of the nociceptive pathway to produce analgesia.1 This case series presents the use of multimodal analgesia for con­ trolling perioperative acute pain in three cats undergo­ ing major surgical procedures in a veterinary teaching institution [Ontario Veterinary College (OVC)]. The rationale for the administration of different analgesics is discussed in each case. Case description Case 1 A 5.3 kg 8-year-old male neutered domestic shorthair (DSH) was presented with caustic burns after acciden­ tally stepping on spilled drain-cleaning product 5 days earlier. The lesions affected all feet, including foot pads, and superficial and deep soft tissues. Approximately 24 h before, the referring veterinarian had administered ketoprofen and meloxicam in close temporal association. On admission to OVC, the cat was ambulatory and pre­ sented with moderate lameness and minimal response to palpation of the limbs. In the emergency setting, intra­ muscular (IM) buprenorphine (0.02 mg/kg) was given and used as part of the anesthetic premedication. Prior to, and under, general anesthesia for wound debride­ ment and repair, blockade of the distal branches of the radial, ulnar, median, common peroneal and tibial nerves was performed with bupivacaine 0.5% (2.5 mg per limb), according to the technique described else­ where.2 Necrotic skin, tendons and multiple phalanges were removed during surgery. Prior to extubation, a sec­ ond dose of buprenorphine (0.02 mg/kg) was adminis­ tered intravenously (IV). During anesthetic recovery, the cat was given medetomidine (1.7 μg/kg IV) owing to emergence delirium. Five hours postoperatively, a con­ stant rate infusion (CRI) of fentanyl was started (1–3 μg/ kg/h IV) for the next 36 h. The cat was then
adminis­ tered buprenorphine again (0.01–0.02 mg/kg IV PRN) until hospital discharge (28 days later). Pain assessment was performed by the attending clinician and trained staff, and was based on the cat’s behavior and response to gentle palpation of the limbs. Gabapentin (18.9 mg/kg PO q8h) was started 24 h after surgery and continued Multimodal analgesia for perioperative pain in three cats Paulo VM Steagall and Beatriz P Monteiro-Steagall Abstract Adequate pain relief is usually achieved with the simultaneous use of two or more different classes of analgesics, often called multimodal analgesia. The purpose of this article is to highlight the use of perioperative multimodal analgesia and the need to individualize the treatment plan based on the presenting condition, and to adjust it based on the response to analgesia for a given patient. This case series presents the alleviation of acute pain in three cats undergoing different major surgical procedures. These cases involved the administration of different classes of analgesic drugs, including opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tramadol, ketamine, gabapentin and local anesthetics. The rationale for the administration of analgesic drugs is discussed herein. Each case presented a particular challenge owing to the different cause, severity, duration and location of pain. Pain management is a challenging, but essential, component of feline practice: multimodal analgesia may minimize stress while controlling acute perioperative pain. Individual response to therapy is a key component of pain relief in cats.

hospitalization. Two weeks after the first inter­ vention, a second surgical procedure was carried out for skin grafts. Premedication, induction agents and local blocks were the same as used in the first anesthetic epi­ sode. Meloxicam (0.1 mg/kg SC) was administered intraoperatively and continued for 4 days postopera­ tively (0.05 mg/kg SC q24h) (Figure 1). Case 2 A 4 kg 13-year-old male neutered DSH was presented for permanent epicardial pacemaker placement and hemi-mandibulectomy after previous diagnostic work- up. No signs of pain-related behaviors were observed or noted during physical examination. The cat was pre­ medicated with butorphanol (0.4 mg/kg IV) and induc­ tion of anesthesia was performed with a combination of ketamine (5 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.25 mg/kg). Lidocaine 2% (20 mg) was infiltrated in the subcutane­ ous (SC) tissue for temporary pacemaker placement via the jugular vein. One and a half hours later, fentanyl (2 μg/kg bolus IV; 5–15 μg/kg/h IV CRI) was started for the surgical procedure. An intercostal nerve block was performed by infiltrating 1.25 mg of bupivacaine 0.5% in each of the two adjacent intercostal nerves cra­ nial and caudal to the left fourth intercostal space where the surgical incision was made.2 The permanent epicar­ dial pacemaker placement was performed via thoracot­ omy followed by a right hemi-mandibulectomy via a ventral approach. Anesthe­ tic recovery was uneventful. Postoperative analgesic drugs included the administra­ tion of meloxicam (0.1 mg/kg SC q24h for 48 h), keta­ mine (2–16 μg/kg/min IV CRI for 24 h) and fentanyl (2–4 μg/kg/h IV CRI for 16 h). The patient was eating well and seemed to be comfortable at discharge 2 days after surgery. Tramadol (2.5 mg/kg PO q8—12h) and meloxicam (0.04 mg/kg PO q24h) were prescribed for 5 days (Figure 2). Case 3 A 9 kg 13-year-old male neutered DSH was presented
for evaluation of a 2-week history of right hind limb lame­ ness and stifle joint instability that were consistent with a cranial cruciate ligament rupture. The cat expressed behavioral signs of pain, such as growling with attempts to escape during palpation of the affected pelvic limb. The cat was admitted for stabilization of the right stifle by performing a right lateral extra-capsular suture tech­ nique. Hydromorphone (0.04 mg/kg) was administered IM as part of the anesthetic premedication. Under gen­ eral anesthesia, an epidural injection with morphine (0.1 mg/kg) and bupivacaine (0.8 mg/kg) was performed; meloxicam (0.08 mg/kg SC) was administered pre- emptively. The surgical procedure lasted for 45 min. Two hours after recovery from anesthesia the cat showed signs of discomfort, including restlessness and vocaliza­ tion. The animal was extremely reactive to touch of the surgical wound area and became extremely aggressive while rolling around the cage. A dose of hydromorphone (0.05 mg/kg IM) was administered, but failed to improve manic reaction of aggression. The clinicians hypothe­ sized that clinical signs were possibly related to central sensitization and wind-up pain. The cat was re-anesthe­ tized and a second epidural injection of bupivacaine, as well as an intra-articular injection of the same local Recovery: Hospital admission: opioid (buprenorphine) + general anaesthesia + local blocks (bupivacaine) for surgical debridement and repair Gabapentin (until hospital Second surgery (skin grafts): opioid (buprenorphine) + general anaesthesia + local blocks (bupivacaine) + meloxicam medetomidine , and removal of phalanges 24h discharge) 5h 0.2h 0h -3h -27h 14 days + (continued for 4 days) 28 days 41h Prior to presentation: NSAIDs ketoprofen + meloxicam End of surgery: pre-recovery opioid (buprenorphine) Opioid CRI (fentanyl for 36h) Hospital discharge Opioid (buprenorphine until hospital discharge) meloxicam Figure 1 Timeline to demonstrate the analgesic drugs that were administered to cat 1

A CRI of fentanyl (2–3 μg/kg/h IV) was instituted for the following 18 h. The cat returned to its normal behavior and appeared to remain comfortable until hospital discharge. The fenta­ nyl CRI was stopped and buprenorphine (0.02 mg/kg IV PRN) was administered for the subsequent 18 h. Prescribed treatments included meloxicam (0.05 mg/kg PO q48h for 5 days) and buprenorphine (8 μg/kg buc­ cally q8h for 2 days). The owners were also instructed to perform ice packing by applying a cold compress to the incision three times daily (Figure 3). Discussion This case series reports the use of multimodal analgesia for the treatment of surgical, with or without pre- existing pain in three cats. Each case is an example of a particular clinical challenge owing to different cause, severity, duration and location of pain.

This is challenging in any veterinary teach­ ing hospital where a single case may be dealt by several different specialists. This report emphasizes the pros and cons of each analgesic therapy, and their combinations employed herein. Opioid drugs produce analgesia by binding to opioid receptors within the central and peripheral nervous sys­ tem. They are the cornerstone for the treatment of acute and postoperative pain if one considers their efficacy, safety margins and versatility.3 Buprenorphine is a par­ tial agonist at µ opioid receptors that binds avidly to, and dissociates slowly from, these receptors.4 The drug was administered to the cat described as case 1 at presen­ tation owing to its provision of long-term moderate analgesia with few adverse effects.5,6 However, buprenor­ phine does not elicit a maximal clinical response as a full agonist. Therefore, had the clinicians known that sur­ gery was recommended immediately, a fentanyl CRI would have been a better option because it provides dose-dependent analgesia as a full-agonist, it can be titrated to effect in order to produce inhalant anesthetic- sparing effects and it may be easily administered for postoperative analgesia. The fentanyl infusion was initi­ ated approximately 5 h after buprenorphine administra­ tion in an attempt to minimize an interaction with buprenorphine; the mixing of opioid analgesics may produce antagonistic
properties and interfere with opti­ mal pain relief as discussed below. The IV route was cho­ sen for administration of buprenorphine after discontinuation of fentanyl CRI because recent studies have shown that the drug provides better anti-nocicep­ tion after IV administration, and has a faster onset of action, when compared with SC or IM administration.7 Following induction of anesthesia, ‘declaw’ blocks, as described previously, were performed to provide anal­ gesia and prevent central sensitization in case 1; this technique has been performed in combination with other analgesic modalities in cats undergoing onychectomy.2 Pre-emptive analgesia (ie, administration of agent before the noxious event) may help to reduce the total amount of anesthetics needed during surgery, as well as anes­ thetic-induced cardiopulmonary depression and the postoperative analgesics required. Local anesthetics are ideal for providing pre-emptive analgesia as these com­ pounds inhibit nervous impulse generation and conduc­ tion by reversibly blocking voltage-dependent sodium channels, thus blocking the transmission of nociceptive input to the spinal cord, and inhibiting central sensitiza­ tion.8 These drugs are relatively safe when appropriate doses and techniques are used, albeit central nervous system and cardiovascular toxic effects may be observed when accidentally administered IV or greater than rec­ ommended amounts are used.9 In all the cases described herein, toxic doses were calculated and care was taken to ensure that IV administration did not occur. Indeed, close monitoring of patients is essential when adminis­ tering local anesthetics at dosages that are close to the ones considered to be toxic for that species. The same cat received medetomidine during anes­ thetic recovery and shortly after extubation. The α2 adr­ energic agonists are sedatives with muscle relaxant and analgesic properties that are widely used in veterinary medicine.10 In our experience, small doses of (dex) medetomidine can be used to treat emergence delirium and/or
dysphoria after general anesthesia in healthy cats. Transient increases in systemic vascular resistance with reflex bradycardia and further decreases in cardiac output are usually observed after α2 adrenergic adminis­ tration. Therefore, their use should be restricted to ani­ mals that can tolerate such cardiovascular effects.11 Gabapentin was administered to cat 1 as neuropathic pain was suspected owing to damage of nerve endings and because the drug has been shown to decrease post­ operative opioid requirements in humans.12 This drug has been used widely in the treatment of neuropathic pain, although its mechanism of action is not fully eluci­ dated, and doses are commonly based on anecdotal reports.13 In cats, the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin have been determined;14 it seems to be effective as an adjuvant analgesic in the treatment of acute pain.15 Increasing doses of up to 50 mg/kg PO have been rec­ ommended.13 Gabapentin may be used adjunctively in the treatment of hyperalgesia and allodynia in order to potentiate the effect of other analgesic drugs.15 Fourteen days after presentation, cat 1 required a sec­ ond surgical intervention, and the anesthetic and analge­ sic protocols were similar to the first episode. At this time, meloxicam was administered for treatment of post­ operative pain for 4 days. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are popular for their anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. Their analgesic effects are secondary to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes in cell membranes.16 In healthy cats, short-term administration of NSAIDs has not been correlated with adverse effects,17 although this may not be the case in cats with naturally-occurring disease in the clinical set­ ting. Cats have limited hepatic glucuronidation and con­ sequent NSAID metabolism,18 which may induce the development of adverse effects, such as gastric irritation, hepatic and renal damage, and inhibition of platelet aggregation.19 Meloxicam was chosen as part of
the pain management protocol as a recent study in cats has shown that its metabolites are products of oxidative metabo­ lism, and excretion occurs primarily via feces.20 This drug was given to all cases with no detectable clinical side effects. In case 1, previously to the first anesthetic episode, the cat had been administered two different NSAIDs in close temporal association and, for this at UNIV OF GUELPH on February 4, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from Steagall and Monteiro-Steagall 5 reason, NSAID treatment was withheld initially. Although a wash-out interval when switching NSAIDs has not been validated, the use of two NSAIDs in close temporal association is contraindicated.21 In case 2, lidocaine was infiltrated in the SC tissue before temporary pacemaker placement via the jugular vein to minimize surgical stimulation and provide anal­ gesia. Prior to the thoracotomy, an intercostal block was performed as part of the multimodal analgesic regimen. A mandibular block could have been beneficial prior to the hemi-mandibulectomy, but other analgesic tech­ niques were preferred owing to the risk of seeding neo­ plastic cells.22 Butorphanol is anκagonist and a µ opioid receptor antagonist that provides mild and short-acting analgesic effects.23 The drug was administered as part of the anes­ thetic premedication in case 2 because temporary pace­ maker placement was deemed to cause only mild pain. Retrospectively, a fentanyl or remifentanil CRI would have been a better option to start with in order to avoid a possible opioid interaction between butorphanol and fentanyl. The clinicians tried to minimize this interaction by initiating the fentanyl CRI approximately 1.5 h after butorphanol administration, when the effects of butor­ phanol were likely to be wearing off.23 In laboratory set­ tings there has been controversy as to whether or not administration of an agonist–antagonist with a pure µ agonist will diminish analgesic
efficacy.24,25 However, mixing full, partial and/or agonist-antagonist opioids should be avoided whenever possible as these combina­ tions may provide less than optimal analgesic effects and unpredictable pain relief in the clinical setting. Intraoperative fentanyl reduces inhalant anesthetic requirements potentially resulting in less cardiopulmo­ nary depression while also providing analgesia.26 Doses of fentanyl were titrated in case 2 depending on require­ ment with lower doses being used to provide the con­ scious cat with analgesia while higher doses were given during surgery in response to painful manipulations. An NSAID and ketamine CRI were combined with fentanyl for postoperative analgesia. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic used commonly in cats. This drug is a non- competitive antagonist of N-methyl D-aspartate recep­ tors involved in the transmission and modulation of nociceptive stimuli in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, a key player in neuropathic and chronic pain.27 As part of a multimodal approach, ketamine has shown to improve postoperative analgesia in dogs undergoing forelimb amputation.28 In this case, ketamine CRI was used as an adjunctive analgesic agent in order to mini­ mize the risk of central sensitization, potentially decreas­ ing opioid requirements. Two days after surgery the same cat was discharged from hospital and prescribed tramadol and meloxicam for 5 days. Tramadol has weak binding affinity at µ receptors, and also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.3 Subcutaneous administration of trama­ dol has limited effect on nociceptive thresholds29 while providing adequate analgesia in cats undergoing ovario­ hysterectomy.30 However, oral administration of trama­ dol provides high oral bioavailability while peak concentrations were reached within 45 mins; doses of 2–4 mg/kg induced significant thermal anti-nociception in cats, possibly making it useful for feline postoperative pain control following hospital discharge.31,32 In cats, dysphoria has been observed after injectable tramadol;29 single administration of the drug does
not alter hemato­ logic or biochemical parameters or gastrointestinal func­ tion.19 In this patient, tramadol did not appear to cause any side effects. The drug was combined with meloxi­ cam because a combination of tramadol-NSAID has been shown to produce superior analgesic efficacy than either treatment alone.19 The cat described in case 3 was premedicated with hydromorphone, which is a full agonist at µ opioid receptors. This drug may be a good option in the clinical setting owing to its low cost, lack of inducing histamine release after IV administration (as may be caused by morphine), high efficacy and long duration of anti- nociceptive effects.33 Hydromorphone has, however, been observed to cause post-anesthetic hyperthermia in cats34 and vomiting,5 similar to other opioids. None of these side effects were observed in this patient. Nonetheless, we recommend close temperature moni­ toring in cats receiving hydromorphone. In our experi­ ence, the administration of this opioid as supplemental analgesia is common in cats undergoing orthopedic sur­ gery; in this patient, however, it failed to provide ade­ quate pain relief. It was hypothesized that the cat had possibly developed central sensitization, which has been reported to occur after intensive nociceptive input and subsequent release of excitatory neurotransmitters. Also known as windup, this phenomenon may be manifested clinically as an exaggerated pain response to low- intensity stimuli or so-called allodynia.35 Epidural administration of local anesthetics and/or opioids can be used to provide sensory and motor nerve blockade caudal to the diaphragm, such as in abdominal and orthopedic surgeries.2 This technique has been used in combination with general anesthesia to reduce anes­ thetic requirements, and improve analgesia and muscle relaxation,36 and was considered to be adequate in case 3. The use of local anesthetics was also performed post- operatively when the cat showed severe signs of pain,
and an intra-articular injection of bupivacaine was per­ formed. The latter procedure has been shown to provide superior analgesia when compared with intra-articular morphine in dogs following stifle surgery.37 In our expe­ rience, the analgesic plan used in case 3 has been suc­ cessful and efficacious in the treatment of perioperative at UNIV OF GUELPH on February 4, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from 6 Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery 0(0) pain after orthopedic surgery in cats. The lack of analge­ sic efficacy may have been owing to individual variabil­ ity in response to a set dose of a specific analgesic treatment. The long-term administration of most of NSAIDs is still considered an off-label treatment in the cat. In some countries (European Union), meloxicam is licensed for long-term use at 0.05 mg/kg/day, and several stud­ ies38,39 have supported its safe use when used at low doses (0.01–0.03 mg/kg/day) in the long term. In case 3, the administration of meloxicam at lower than labeled doses was an attempt to use the lowest effective dosage while ensuring adequate analgesia.40 In all cases, close monitoring was recommended to owners, who were fully informed about off-label administration of NSAIDs and the possible side effects. The use of multimodal therapy for the treatment of pain in cats is of utmost importance; opioids are consid­ ered to be the mainstay of acute pain management used in combination with local anesthetic blocks and NSAIDs. Other classes of analgesics (eg, gabapentin, tramadol, ketamine CRI) may be administered for specific condi­ tions as alternative adjuvants. Critical pain recognition and assessment is a key component to tailor analgesic treatment to the individual needs on a case-by-case basis. The literature suggests that there are likely to be genetic differences between individuals and response to therapy in cats.41 Multimodal analgesia did not produce
undesirable therapeutic effects in the present case series; however, awareness that drug interactions may lead to side effects is warranted. For example, opioids may pro­ duce bradycardia and dose-dependent respiratory depression in cats that becomes more pronounced with co-administration of anesthetic agents and/or sedatives in patients undergoing general anesthesia.3 Conclusions This case series reported the successful treatment of acute pain in three cats using a multimodal approach. Pain management is a challenging, but essential, component of feline clinical practice, and multimodal analgesia may minimize stress while controlling perioperative acute pain. Rational administration of analgesic drugs may vary according to the cause, severity, duration and loca­ tion of pain, as well as differences between individual patients. Future investigations may provide a clear understanding of the potential side effects after the com­ bined administration of analgesic drugs.

Pain associated with interstitial
cystitis may be more prevalent than previously thought because outward signs (eg, urinating outside the litter box) may not always be present.6,7 Causes & Risk Factors ●Acute pain in cats is most commonly associated with trauma or postoperative pain. Other causes (eg, lower urinary tract disease, pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, cholangiohepatitis, pleuritis, upper respiratory tract infections, and obstipa- tion) should be investigated if the cause is not readily apparent. PROFILE Definitions ●Pain is an aversive sensory experience that causes response with protective motor actions, resulting in learned avoid- ance of the experience.1 In addition to the sensory experience, there is an affective/emotional compo- nent.2 ●Adaptive pain, which is defined as an appropriate hypersensitive response to a potentially damag- ing stimulus, is respon- sive to medication.3 ●Maladaptive pain (commonly referred to as wind-up pain), defined as sponta- neous hypersensi- tivity resulting from abnormal processing of a stimulus by the central nervous system (CNS), does not respond to treatment.3 ●Allodynia is pain caused by a stimulus that does not normally provoke pain, according to the International Association for the Study of Pain.4 Allodynia can be a component of mal- adaptive pain.2 ●In cats, assessment of pain sensation cannot C O N T I N U E S FIND MORE Go to page 24 to see Determining Pain Scores in Cats or download it at cliniciansbrief.com. Chronic Pain Signs of chronic pain in cats may be markedly different from those seen in dogs. Cats that demonstrate aggression or have pain that does not respond to opioids or NSAIDs may have maladaptive pain. ●Changes in behavior—less social with owners, aggression toward members of the household, urinating outside litter box ●Decreased appetite, weight loss, and disinter- est in normal activities; however, these signs have many causes11 ●Signs of chronic pain attributed to “normal aging” include
increased sleeping; decreased jumping, climbing, or overall activity; and reluctance to be petted10 DIAGNOSIS ●Diagnosing the cause of pain is important to its elimination or, at least, to its control. Repeated examinations are vital to anticipate changes needed in pain management (Figures 2 and 3). ●Pain management may need to change with progressive diseases (eg, osteoarthritis, cancer, intervertebral disk disease) or in hospice patients.2 ●Owners should learn the signs of pain in cats and how these differ from signs in dogs. In some cases, clinic visits for repeat examina- tions to assess effectiveness of pain manage- ment stress the cat extensively; the owner’s assessment of the cat’s comfort level may be employed in those cases. TREATMENT Precautions Compared with other species, cats have fewer hepatic phase II enzymes (such as uridine 5- diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase); therefore, they cannot metabolize drugs that are excreted as glucuronide conjugates.8 Consequently, some dosages and dosing intervals may be very differ- Pa t i e n t S u p p o r t C O N T I N U E D 20..................................................................................................................................................................NAVC Clinician’s Brief / September 2010 / Patient Support Cats in acute pain hold their heads down and squint their eyes, or they may hide their heads. When in a crate or cage, they often have hunched backs and do not move around or respond to humans. 1 ●Causes of chronic pain are varied but may include degenerative joint disease, dental and gum disease, neoplasia, interstitial cystitis, dermatitis, and chronic wounds.8 ●Risks for acute or chronic pain vary according to cause of the pain stimulus, but the risk for chronic pain increases with age. ●Risk for maladaptive pain increases when adaptive pain is not appropriately managed. Pathophysiology ●Maladaptive pain develops when adaptive pain is untreated for a prolonged period, resulting in sensitization of dorsal
horn neu- rons. Maladaptive pain may be present with or following resolution of adaptive pain. ●As the threshold for pain sensation is low- ered, wind-up pain develops in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Pain wind-up can worsen acute pain and cause chronic maladaptive pain. ●Nociceptors throughout the body can convert a chemical, thermal, or mechanical stimulus into an electrical impulse through a process termed transduction. This impulse is transmit- ted from the periphery to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, then the brain and thalamus, and finally the cerebral cortex.9 Signs Acute Pain ●Hiding or holding head down, squinting the eyes (Figure 1) ●Licking or biting the surgical site ●Hunched back, resisting movement ●Ignoring attempts by humans to interact ●Not urinating (even with a full bladder), eat- ing, or drinking8,10 ent in cats compared to dogs. For example, drugs such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) are toxic to cats. Several NSAIDs are also very slowly metab- olized and should be avoided. Analgesia Strategies Perioperative Analgesia Opioids may reduce anesthetic requirements in patients undergoing elective surgery. Local anesthetics and perioperative NSAIDs not only prevent acute pain but also decrease the risk for maladaptive pain.2 However, clinicians must account for risks associated with preexisting conditions, such as liver disease, renal disease, gastrointestinal disorders, blood clotting abnor- malities, and drug hypersensitivities. Postoperative Analgesia For many procedures, pain continues beyond the first 12 to 24 hours. Abrupt cessation of analgesia can result in maladaptive pain and delayed heal- ing and recovery from surgery. After the patient is stable and can eat/drink following surgery, pain management should be modified to a regimen that can be continued by the owner. This allows the practitioner to assess the efficacy of the anal- gesic protocol and make adjustments as necessary before sending the patient home. Chronic Pain
Analgesia ●NSAIDs, such as meloxicam, can control chronic pain and improve quality of life for many cats. ●Ancedotal reports suggest that the NMDA antagonist amantadine may also be useful for treating chronic and maladaptive pain. ●Gabapentin, which inhibits not only neuro- pathic pain but also pain associated with inflammation,12 has been used with some suc- cess in cats with lumbar nerve root entrapment due to fractures or degenerative disk changes. I have also had success using it (3 mg/kg PO Q 12 H) to relieve pain associated with feline osteoarthritis. ●Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, may offer another mode of treatment for chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis and inflam- matory bowel disease. MEDICATIONS Opioids Due to genetic variability of opioid receptors, one opioid may work well as an analgesic in one cat but not in another.8,13,14 Following declaw sur- gery, an opioid (such as buprenorphine) may be more effective than an NSAID. ●Hydromorphone: Shown to cause nausea and vomiting in cats, especially when administered subcutaneously.15 Has been associated with elevated body temperature up to 108.5° F at doses of 0.1 mg/kg; lower intravenous doses (0.025–0.05 mg/kg) do not produce such increases but may not provide sufficient pain relief.8 Morphine is not frequently used in cats because it also causes vomiting and has a slow onset of action.8,16 ●Oxymorphone: Provides excellent analgesic effects that may be enhanced by addition of acepromazine.17 Hyperthermia is not commonly encountered at low doses.

Reported to be effective for pain related to interstitial cystitis; however, its ceiling effect prevents dose increases from producing greater analgesia.14 Butorphanol’s duration of action is less than 90 minutes when given intravenously. Oral administration is possible, but the tablet may be difficult to administer; there are also no published data on the bioavailability of butorphanol follow- ing oral administration in cats.8 ●Buprenorphine: Available as a liquid that is absorbed by transmucosal uptake; has excel- lent bioavailability. Analgesia can last 6 hours regardless of the route of administration. ●Fentanyl transdermal patches: Used in cats; however, the plasma concentrations achieved are variable; some may never achieve an analgesic concentration.18 Cats must be monitored closely for signs that pain is adequately controlled. ●Tramadol: Oral tramadol (10 mg/kg) was shown to lower minimum alveolar concentra- tion (MAC) of sevoflurane in cats if given 5 minutes before induction; however, some cats vomited or hypersalivated following adminis- tration of this high dose.19 Further investiga- tion is needed before it can be recommended. Oral tramadol is bitter and can be
difficult to administer. NSAIDs For soft-tissue surgery (eg, ovariohysterectomy), an NSAID, such as meloxicam or ketoprofen, may provide adequate analgesia.8,20 NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes 1 and 2 with variable effects on gastric mucosal integrity, platelet function, and renal autoregula- tion. Because many are metabolized by glu- curonidation in the liver (except for meloxicam, which undergoes oxidation), frequent dosing may cause drug accumulation and toxicity.8 Long-term meloxicam use for chronic pain in cats is not approved by the FDA (only a single dose is approved); however, long-term use at the lowest possible dose can provide improved com- fort in cats. I monitor renal function, hepatic enzyme levels, and packed cell volume monthly to detect early signs of toxicity. If gastrointestinal erosions are suspected (due to decreases in packed cell volume and diminished liver or renal function), discontinuation of therapy is recom- mended. ●Carprofen: Has a highly variable half-life of anywhere from 9 to 49 hours depending on the individual cat; it is not recomended.21,22 However, it has been approved for use in other countries and may be effective when administered as a single dose. ●Meloxicam: A COX-2 selective NSAID that may be used for postoperative pain or chronic pain. In my experience, meloxicam combined with buprenorphine can provide adequate postoperative analgesia, and most owners are able to administer these medications at home. Studies have shown that as many as 18% of cats can develop gastrointestinal upset while receiving meloxicam, but generally these effects are not sufficiently severe to require withdrawal of the medication.23,24 Low-dose oral meloxicam has been shown to be effective for osteoarthritis pain in 85% of cases.8,25 Cats had no signs of renal side effects after 5 months of continuous use, although 4% did develop gastrointestinal upset.25 In cats with normal serum biochemical profiles, I use an induction
dose of 0.1 mg/kg, then 0.1 mg per cat Q 24 H thereafter while monitoring blood analysis monthly. NMDA Antagonists ●Ketamine: Most widely recognized NMDA antagonist. Has analgesic properties that specifically inhibit central sensitization, or wind-up pain, and maladaptive pain. Low-dose infusions of ketamine produce analgesia; however, it can cause significant hyperalgesia in cats that are not experiencing painful stimuli.26 Since effects of ketamine in cats have not been clearly defined, its use in clinical settings may not be warranted postop- eratively, but it may be used as a component of anesthesia induction protocol. ●Amantadine: Has been reported to successfully control chronic pain in cats and may be better suited for maladaptive chronic pain than other COMPLICATIONS Long-term use of any analgesic requires careful monitoring because agents used may not remain effective as the disease being treated progresses. Gastrointestinal upset, renal disease, liver disease, and other complications may develop over time and require drug doses or dosing intervals to be adjusted accordingly. Occasionally, drugs may have to be discontinued. FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS In the future, more options will become available to veterinarians for the treatment of pain in cats; however, these drugs must be adequately investi- gated for safety and efficacy before they can be recommended for widespread use. Until then, recognizing pain in cats is the first challenge to overcome, followed by adequately treating that pain.

Side effects that can occur with lower doses include anxiety, restlessness, and dry mouth. Amanta- dine has been used with NSAIDs in dogs to treat pain associated with osteoarthritis and osteosarcoma; there are anecdotal reports of its successful use in cats with similar conditions.8,12 Gabapentin Gabapentin’s mechanism of action is unknown, but it has been used adjunctively to treat neuropathic and inflammation-associated pain in humans. It has also been used in combination with an NSAID to manage osteoarthritis in dogs12 and has been successfully used alone in cats for pain associated with lumbar nerve root entrapment from fractures or degenerative disk disease.28 Because gabapentin is excreted in the urine, dosage and frequency must be adjusted for patients with renal insufficiency.28 I successfully treated a cat that had osteoarthritis- related pain and chronic liver disease with a combi- nation of gabapentin (3 mg/kg PO Q 12 H) and meloxicam (0.1 mg PO Q 4 days). Tricyclic Antidepressants Pain associated with interstitial cystitis has been successfully treated
with amitriptyline, but some cats may have subsidence of clinical signs within several days even when no treatment is administered. Amitriptyline may have some benefit in the treatment of chronic pain from osteoarthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, but more research is needed to assess its efficacy for these conditions.8 FOLLOW-UP Patient Monitoring Cats receiving chronic analgesic therapy should have physical examinations, complete blood counts, urinalyses, and serum biochemical pro- files performed once monthly or more frequently if they have concurrent chronic illnesses, such as renal or liver disease. Treatment of the underly- ing condition is always the foremost concern, and response to that treatment ultimately determines the prognosis.

Dahl,.MD Department of Surgical Gastroenterology and Anesthesiology, Hvidovre University Hospital, Hvidovre, Denmark reatment o f postoperative pain is provided for humanitarian reasons and to alleviate nocicep- T tion-induced responses, such as the endocrine metabolic response to surgery, autonomic reflexes with adverse effects on organ function, reflexes lead- ing to muscle spasm, and other undesirable results (1). During the last decade there has been a virtual ex- plosion in our knowledge of basic pain physiology (2,3), but the implications for clinical practice have been less substantial. The explanation for the discrep- ancy between the fast progress in basic pain patho- physiology and the rather slow advances in providing optimal postoperative pain treatment may be several, but one important factor may be that more than 95% o f the literature on postoperative pain treatment has con- sidered unimodal treatment. W e have emphasized previously that total or optimal pain relief allowing normal function can not be achieved by
a single drug or method without major strain on equipment and surveillance systems or without significant side effects ( 4 ) . Therefore, we have recommended combined anal- gesic regimens (balanced analgesia) or a multimodal approach to the treatment of postoperative pain ( 4 ) . The rationale for this strategy is achievement of suffi- cient analgesia due to additive or synergistic effects between different analgesics, with concomitant reduc- tion of side effects, due to resulting lower doses of analgesics and differences in side-effect profiles. W e summarize here the existing knowledge con- cerning the efficacy of analgesic combination therapy from postoperative pain studies. The effects on post- operative outcome are not included, because of lack of sufficient studies. W e also exclude obstetric and pedi- atric pain, which may represent special pain entities and solutions for treatment, although they obviously share many of the problems of general postoperative pain.

Thus, single-dose combination therapy will not be dis- cussed unless vital to interpretation and to under- standing future approaches to prolonged combination therapy. We also did not review efficacy data from single modality treatments, because these have been reviewed elsewhere. Background Figure 1 shows the pathways o f nociceptive stimuli, including those conducting pain, from the site of sur- gical injury passing through the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system. At present, sev- eral techniques are available to treat pain: at the peripheral level using local anesthetics,
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), opioids, or other an- algesics; peripheral nerve blocks with local anesthetics and a2-adrenergic agonists; at the spinal cord level us- ing local anesthetics, opioids, a2-agonists or other an- algesics; at the cortical level using opioids or other an- algesics; and, finally, a combination of these techniques. In the following, data on the efficacy and side effects of combination therapy, compared with unimodal therapy, are discussed with an emphasis on pain relief during function, such as cough and mobilization, rather than merely during rest. Peripheral-Acting Analgesics Local Anesthetics Local anesthetics have been used for several decades for wound infiltration, but their application and effi- cacy has been documented mostly in relatively minor or moderate procedures (5). The effect on postoperative pain is rather short-lasting, emphasizing the severe need for more long-acting drugs (5). There are few studies that evaluate the efficacy of combining other analgesic therapy with the administration of local anesthetics. This is unfortunate, because a combined peripheral attack on pain seems rational. 1048 Anesth Analg 1993;T71048-56 01993 by the International Anesthesia Research Society 0003-2999/93/$5.00 ANESTH ANALG 1993;77:1048-56 measures l o provlde portopernllve peln rellel REVIEW ARTICLE KEHLET AND DAHL 1049 BALANCED ANALGESIA - "balanced analgesia" "multi-modal paln lherapv" central nsural blockade iepldural/lnlretliecal local aneslhellcs, oplolds. a,-agonlalrl TflAUMA anlegonlsm of endogenous algeslc subrtancea and of lnflan~melory response llocal eneithellcs, NSAID'a. oplolds. glucocorlicolds. 01CI Figure 1. Measures to provide pain relief. Peripheral Opioid Instillation Some clinical studies recently have demonstrated pe- ripheral instillation of morphine to reduce postarthro- scopic pain (6-10). The analgesic effect probably is mediated through inflammatory-induced novel ap- pearance of opioid receptors at the peripheral nerve endings (11). The efficacy of combining intraarticular local anesthetics and opioids may be important, but so far, the experience has been discordant (8,lO). Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs (NSAID) The
value of NSAfDs in minor, moderate, or severe postoperative pain is well documented (12,131, but their efficacy is too small to be the sole analgesic in more severe pain states, although they represent an ideal alternative component in the multimodal ap- proach to postoperative pain treatment. Additive or synergistic effects of combining NSAID with systemic opioids are well documented in minor surgery (14-161, but most combination studies of NSAID and opioids have aimed to demonstrate the ability of additional NSAID to reduce the amount of opioid, resulting in a similar degree or only slightly improved pain relief (12,13). Although this approach may be valuable for minor procedures, such as laparoscopy, with subse- quent reduction of opioid-induced side effects (nausea, vomiting, sedation), a fixed-dose combination therapy theoretically should enhance the analgesic potency that is necessary in moderate or major surgery. So far, only one such study is available. It demonstrates improved analgesia by fixed-dose combination with piroxicam and opioid after total hip replacement (17). The com- bination of systemic NSAID with a central neural block with bupivacaine and/or opioids has been studied in major abdominal (18) and thoracic surgery (19), in which additional treatment with piroxicam 20-40 mg daily did not improve analgesia during rest, cough, or mobilization during an otherwise effective epidural low-dose bupivacaine-opioid regimen. Further studies of such triple combination therapy, especially in soft- and bone-tissue trauma such as orthopedic procedures are needed. After cesarean section the combination of low-dose epidural morphine and intramuscular diclof- enac provided analgesia superior to either drug alone (20). In experimental studies, local NSAID application for burn injuries has proven effective in reducing various aspects of the injury response as well as pulmonary complications (21), but the analgesic effect in clinical burn injury is debatable (22). No information is avail- able from local instillation
of NSAID in surgical pro- cedures. Combination of systemic NSAID with intra- articular bupivacaine may reduce pain and analgesic requirements (23). So far, no NSAID has been proven superior regard- ing efficacy or side effects (12,131 and choice of prepa- ration therefore may depend on other factors, such as duration and site of administration (intravenous, sup- positories, oral, cream). Short-lasting (<1 wk) treat- ment with NSAIDs does not seem to have clinically significant side effects (12,131, except in high-risk pa- tients with hypovolemia, renal failure, active or recent gastroduodenal ulcer, or bleeding disorders (12,13). 1050 REVIEW ARTICLE KEHLET AND DAHL ANESTH ANALG BALANCED ANALGESIA 1993;771048-56 The use of other modifiers of the primary hyperal- gesic (inflammatory) response has not been evaluated in clinical postoperative pain, as far as leukotriene synthesis inhibitors, bradykinin-, substance-P-, or serotonin-antagonists, and a2-agonists are concerned. Therefore, no data are available on combination regi- mens with these drugs together with other peripheral acting analgesics. In conclusion, treatment with peripheral-acting an- algesics may be an important component of multimo- dal pain therapy in the future, but, because there is a lack of data, no firm recommendations can be given. However, the combined use of NSAID and opioids seems rational and is supported by the available data. Peripheral Nerve Blocks The gold standard for peripheral nerve blocks is local anesthetics, and recently there have been efforts to pro- long or optimize analgesic efficacy by combining the local anesthetic with opioids or clonidine (24,25). In this respect there is some evidence from experimental iso- lated nerve studies that clonidine may enhance the ef- fects of lidocaine on C-fiber action potentials (26). How- ever, at present, the results are clinically inconclusive and recommendations can not be given. One study has demonstrated additive analgesic effects by a combina- tion of cryoanalgesia and
rectal indomethacin after thoracotomy (27). Central Neural Blocks with Local Anesthetics, Opioids, and a,-Agonists The clinical data showing the additive/synergistic an- algesic effects of combining epidural local anesthetics, opioids, and a2-agonists are in accordance with results from experimental studies. Experimentally, intrathecal local anesthetics poten- tiate spinal morphine antinociception (28,29) and to- gether inhibit prolonged poststimulation discharge (wind-up) of the dorsal horn cells (30). The synergism between morphine and lidocaine also exists in visceral nociception models, and may be more profound than the inhibition of somatic nociception (31). The mecha- nism for the additive /synergistic effects between spi- nal local anesthetic and opioid effects has not been evaluated clearly (29), although bupivacaine may fa- cilitate morphine-induced antinociception by confor- mational changes in spinal opioid receptors with de- creased binding to preceptors but increased binding to 6- and K-receptors (32). Experimental studies have also shown additive effects between intrathecal opioid and a-adrenergic agonists (33-35). This has been confirmed i n more recent studies also demonstrating additive ef- fects between intrathecal morphine combined with norepinephrine, carbacol, or midazolam (36). Epidural Local Anesthetic-Opioid Combinations Morphine enhances pain relief and the spread of sen- sory analgesia during continuous epidural bupiva- caine infusion (37). Tables 1 and 2 summarize the avail- able data from double-blind or single-blind studies, matched, or other sufficient comparative studies inves- tigating the analgesic power of continuous epidural lo- cal anesthetic with or without opioid or epidural opioid with or without local anesthetic. The interpretation is hindered somewhat by differences in design, but due to the relatively large number of studies, reasonable conclusions and directions for the use and future ap- plications of such mixtures can be made. A variable dose regimen, not always presenting exact infusion rates, has been performed in about half of the available studies (3844). High-dose bupivacaine-morphine in-
fusions have been used in the studies by Hjorts~ et al. (45) and Scott et al. (46), who used doses so large that they can not be recommended for common clinical use. However, these studies are included because they are appropriate for the discussion of potential additive/ synergistic effects of combining local anesthetics and opioids. The study by Badner and Komar (431, which is negative for the combination therapy, can not be com- pared to the other studies, since a lumbar (Ll-3) epi- dural catheter with local anesthetic infusion was used, despite the fact that operations were upper abdominal or thoracic procedures. To examine whether a combination of local anes- thetic and opioid is more effective than either local an- esthetic or the opioid alone, studies have been divided into two groups: studies in which the basic analgesic solution was opioid with or without additional local anesthetic, OY studies in which the basic analgesic so- lution was local anesthetic with or without additional opioid (Table 2). In all studies in which the basic in- fusion consisted of bupivacaine, additional opioid im- proved analgesia (Table 2). On the other hand, the stud- ies using opioid as a basic analgesic solution with or without additional local anesthetic administration do not agree, inasmuch as only three studies showed im- proved analgesia by the combination (40,42,47), whereas five studies (38,39,41,43,48), could not dem- onstrate improved analgesic power by the combination versus the opioid infusion alone. In this context, only two studies have assessed pain during rest as well as during cough, mobilization, or exercise (42,471. This is important because in both these studies, the superiority in analgesic power of the combination therapy, versus opioid infusion alone, only became manifest when pain was assessed during cough, mobilization, and exercise, but not during pain at rest

Side Effects Regarding side effects of the different low-dose regi- mens, the relatively small size of these studies does not allow conclusions as to the clinical relevance and rec- ommendations. In most studies, respiratory depression or orthostatic hypotension has not occurred, although the latter has not been studied sufficiently with well- defined criteria. However, in the moderate size infu- sion rate study by Lee et al. (49) the bupivacaine group had an unacceptably high incidence of motor block. Limb weakness also was found in 2 of 20 patients in the bupivacaine infusion regimens by George et al. (44). Also, two cases o f muscle paralysis were found by Bad- ner and Komar (43) in the bupivacaine infusion group o f 15 patients receiving lumbar epidural analgesia, de- spite upper abdominal and thoracic
procedures. One case o f respiratory depression was found in the bupi- vacaine only group by Logas et al. (39) and in the bupivacaine-fentanyl group by Badner et al. (41) and in the sufentanil group by Mourisse et al. (42). In the only available study of the risk of adverse car- diovascular responses to mobilization and walking with or without a low-dose epidural bupivacaine- morphine combination (10 mg/0.2 mg/h), no risk was found by flzoracic epidural analgesia in patients under- going cholecystectomy (50). Obviously, similar weI1- defined studies on cardiovascular function during low- dose Zumbar epidural infusions are needed to allow clinical recommendations of optima1 dose regimens. With regard to bladder function, differences in de- sign, as well as indications for a postoperative urinary bladder catheter and time for removal, preclude any conclusions as to the most optimal combination. Inasmuch as the available data seem to indicate that the combined epidural local anesthetic-opioid therapy is most efficient on pain during function, four questions need to be answered: 1) Is continuous or intermittent therapy preferable? 2) Which local anesthetic and opi- oid should be used? 3) Where should the epidural cath- eter for the combined local anesthetic-opioid admin- istration be inserted? 4) What are the optimal dosage regimens? Intermittent or Continuous Infusion With regard to intermittent versus continuous infusion therapy, there is probably not much difference in effi- cacy during opioid therapy, at least not with the longer-acting drugs such as morphine and diamor- phine (51,521, although similar studies are not avail- able with the shorter-acting lipophilic drugs. Local anesthetics need to be administered by an infusion (531, because intermittent injections will increase the risk of adverse effects, such as muscle paralysis, orthostatic hypotension, and bladder dysfunction, although good comparative studies are not available. Choice of Opioid Lipophilic opioids may have
a segmental analgesic ef- fect, thereby hopefully limiting side effects (e.g., res- piratory depression, nausea, vomiting). However, this conclusion has not been proven by any large scale study. In one obstetrical pain study, fentanyl led to a reduced incidence of nausea and pruritus compared with morphine when combined with bupivacaine (54). An unblinded and variable dose study in major ortho- pedic surgery found more nausea and pruritus and higher Paco2 values after morphine (about 0.4 mg/h), but less sedation compared with fentanyl (about 50 pg/h) (55). Another variable dose study showed com- parable analgesia, but less pruritus after hydromor- phone, compared with morphine (56). ANESTH ANALG 1993;771048-56 Morphine (57-59) and probably diamorphine (60,61) have more analgesic efficacy when used epidurally compared with systemic administration. When using the lipophilic opioids, a comparison of epidural versus intravenous fentanyl(62-691, sufentanil(70), and alfen- tanil(71), have almost uniformly shown no significant differences in analgesic power or side effects between the two routes of administration. The choice of opioid for the epidural mixtures, therefore, may depend on other factors, such as price or availability, and in many places morphine may be the optimal opioid. The risk of late respiratory depression may be higher after morphine, but based upon the experience with the recent low- dose, continuous infusion regimens (about 0.2 mg of morphine or about 50-80 pg/h of fentanyl), the large study from Seattle (72) and the nationwide observa- tions from Sweden (73) after higher single or multiple dose administrations, this risk must be extremely low and is probably even lower than after intermittent sys- temic opioid administration with conventional doses. Finally, late respiratory depression after fentanyl also has been reported (74), and there is no indication of a reduced risk with long-term use of sufentanil or alfentanil. The potential use of mixtures of opioids to
enhance analgesia has not been evaluated, although prelimi- nary observations may suggest a more rapid onset and prolonged duration by combining epidural morphine and fentanyl or epidural morphine and sufentanil (75,761. Choice of Local Anesthetic Although few studies are available, bupivacaine is most suitable due to its long duration and absent neuro- and cardiotoxicity with low-dose infusion rates (53). Furthermore, most experience comes from this drug. Therefore, bupivacaine must be considered the drug of choice for epidural postoperative combination therapy, unless new local anesthetics will be available with a more favorable sensory/motor block profile. Site of Injection Insertion of the epidural catheter should be at the middermatomal level of the incision when local anes- thetics are used (53). This is in contrast to the use of epidural opioids, in studies in which morphine (77,78) or fentanyl (69,79) have not demonstrated significant differences between thoracic or lumbar application. Choice of Dosage Definitive recommendations for dosage can not be given before more information is available from large scale studies comparing analgesic efficacy and risk of side effects, especially the risk of orthostatic REVIEW ARTICLE KEHLET AND DAHL BALANCED ANALGESIA 1053 hypotension during early postoperative mobilization and bladder dysfunction. Also, such studies should evaluate the potential reduction in dosage when com- bined with an appropriate NSAID or other analgesics. So far, during upper abdominal or thoracic proce- dures, a combination of bupivacaine (approximately 10 mg/h) and morphine (about 0.2 mg/h with a loading dose of 1-2 mg of morphine, dependent on age), seems to be most appropriate. This regimen may not have orthostatic hypotensive effects when used as thoracic epidural analgesia (50). During lumbar epidural anal- gesia, less local anesthetic, probably in the range of 2.5-5 mg/h, has to be used due to the risk of motor block and orthostatic hypotension, although sufficient
data on the risk/benefit ratio are not available. The amount of opioids may be the same as during upper abdominal and thoracic procedures, i.e., morphine 0.2 mg/h or fentanyl approximately 50-80 pg/h. Epidural a,-Agonists and Mixtures There is considerable experimental evidence that in- trathecal or epidural a2-agonists have an analgesic ef- fect (33-35) and several single-dose clinical studies have documented postoperative analgesic efficacy when used alone or an enhanced effect when used in combinations with local anesthetics or opioids (80-83). When used epidurally, the analgesic effect of clonidine may be due not only to a segmental spinal effect, but also to absorption and a systemic effect (81). For severe pain, combinations of clonidine with other analgesics (i.e., local anesthetics and opioids) may be appropriate to increase analgesic power and reduce side effects. This may be clinically important, because clonidine has a different side-effect profile compared with opioids. Thus, hypotension and seda- tion and the lack of respiratory side effects are the most relevant. So far, only three double-blind randomized studies are available with continuous infusion of cloni- dine, either as a combination of clonidine (19 pg/h) and morphine versus morphine alone ( 8 4 ) , or comparing clonidine 25 pg/h or 50 pg/h versus low-dose mor- phine or combined morphine-clonidine (851, or com- paring a low-dose bupivacaine-morphine regimen with or without clonidine (19 pg/h) (86). The results of these studies are concordant in that the combination of clonidine and morphine improved analgesia compared with morphine (84,85) or compared with low-dose clonidine alone (85) and also when added to a low-dose epidural bupivacaine-morphine regimen (86). How- ever, hypotension was observed in all three studies. In conclusion, the addition of clonidine to epidural combination regimens will increase analgesic power, but the infusion rates studied so far (19-25 pg/h) have resulted in
hypotension. Although systematic dose- response studies on the risk of orthostatic hypotension 1054 REVIEW ARTICLE KEHLET AND DAHL BALANCED ANALGESIA ANESTH ANALG 1993;77 1048-56 are not available, these findings limit the recommen- dation for continuous postoperative epidural clonidine therapy. Nevertheless, the positive analgesic results call for further combination studies using a lower dose rate o f clonidine or other a2-agonists. The use of droperidrol, a dopamine-receptor antago- nist with weak aI- and a2-agonist properties, did not improve pain relief after hip surgery when combined with morphine, but resulted in fewer side effects (87). Combinations o f Peripheral and Central Analgesic Treatment or Other Mixtures As previously mentioned, the combination of peripheral-acting analgesics (i.e., NSAID and others) with low-dose epidural regimens seems rational in more severe states of pain to improve analgesia and reduce side effects. However, only two such double- blind studies are available. These are not sufficient to demonstrate additional analgesic power via the addi- tion of piroxicam to an otherwise effective low-dose epidural bupivacaine-morphine regimen after abdomi- nal and thoracic surgery (18,191. This area definitely requires further exploration with other NSAIDs or other peripheral analgesics during different proce- dures, especially soft tissue trauma surgery, where NSAIDs may be more efficient. In an approach combining peripherally acting anal- gesics (NSAID) together with epidural bupivacaine- morphine, the additional effect of a preoperative high- dose glucocorticoid was studied to modify various humoral mediators including pain mediators (arachi- donic cascade metabolites, cytokines) (88,89). In both of these small scale studies, a very efficient and espe- cially prolonged pain relief was observed (88,89), and were more efficient than with the epidural combina- tion therapy and NSAID alone (88). These preliminary observations obviously call for further studies regard- ing the efficacy, as well as the potential side effects, of additional glucocorticoid therapy. Conclusions and
Future Directions From the available data on the postoperative use of multimodal pain therapy or balanced analgesia, this strategy seems advantageous, inasmuch as analgesic power may be enhanced. However, the expected gain by reducing the risk of side effects compared with more intensive single modality treatment, needs to be evaluated in large scale studies. Also, the optimal com- bination therapy needs to be evaluated regarding com- position and duration for the various surgical proce- dures. However, at present there is no doubt that during major surgery, continuous epidural, low-dose combination regimens with local anesthetic and opi- oid are the most effective, and provide an apparent low risk of complications. Again, the benefits obtained from analgesia and, thereby, the possibility for early mobilization hastening of convalescence and reduc- tion in hospital stay, has to be weighed against the potential risks and the cost of surveillance. Furthermore, the use of multimodal pain therapy in conjunction with effective preemptive analgesia (i.e., an- algesia given before the painful stimulus) needs to be studied, because preliminary uncontrolled observa- tions have been positive (90). Thus, the use of preemp- tive analgesia may improve, at least theoretically, the analgesic power of subsequent balanced analgesia (91), although a continuous postoperative treatment may be more important than a short-lasting preemp- tive analgesia alone (92). Finally, the use of patient-controlled rnultimodal therapy has to be evaluated, inasmuch as most studies have used rather fixed dosage regimens, which may be sub- optimal due to the well-documented, pronounced in- terpatient variability in analgesic needs after surgery. In conclusion, the data on multimodal, or balanced, analgesia is relatively scarce compared to studies on the single modality treatment of postoperative pain. Fu- ture postoperative pain studies should include such regimens rather than to simply continue investigations of single modality treatment, although single modality treatment
studies are obviously useful in the evalua- tion of new drugs and techniques. The approach that combines the consideration of peripheral and central treatment of pain, possibly in combination with pre- emptive analgesia, may contribute eventually to a post- operative course without pain, and one that provides for very early mobilization and restoration of function with subsequent reduction in postoperative morbidity and hospital stay.
