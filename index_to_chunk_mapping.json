{"0": "A Review of Opioid Use in Cats Author(s): Robertson S. In: Recent Advances in Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia: Companion Animals by Gleed R. and Ludders J. Updated: JUN 25, 2007 Languages: EN Introduction There are an estimated 200 million cats (Felis catus) kept as pets worldwide and in many countries including the United States of America (USA), the United Kingdom (UK) and China, pet cats outnumber pet dogs [1]. The need for peri-operative pain management is great since the majority of pet cats are spayed or castrated and in the USA many continue to be declawed. The feline practitioner is faced with several challenges when managing pain in cats including the lack of validated pain assessment tools, the cat\u2019s unique metabolism of many drugs, and the lack of licensed analgesic drugs. In the past, our understanding and treatment of pain in cats has lagged behind what is available for dogs, but fortunately in the last decade many advances have been made in feline analgesia and many cat-specific studies, both laboratory-based and clinical, have been published. There are many causes of acute pain in cats including surgery, trauma, procedural pain, and several medical conditions such as peritonitis and cystitis. Opioids are the mainstay of any analgesic protocol for the management of acute pain. The incidence of chronic pain in cats is not well documented but is associated with many conditions including osteoarthritis, cancer, interstitial cystitis, dental and gum disease, long- standing dermatitis, and wounds. It is only recently that we have begun to appreciate what the true incidence of osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease might be in cats and it appears to be much more common than previously thought and could be a major cause of discomfort, especially in ageing cats [2-4]. Although opioids are used for long-term alleviation of chronic", "1": "pain in humans there are only anecdotal reports of their use for this purpose in cats. The aim of this paper is to review current knowledge of opioid use in cats and their place in pain management. Drug Metabolism www.ivis.org Cats have a low capacity to handle drugs that require hepatic glucuronidation, a fact elucidated by molecular genetic studies. Domestic cats have fewer hepatic UDP-glucuroninosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms which represent major phase II drug metabolizing enzymes, as a result of mutations of UGT and the presence of pseudogenes [5-7]. It is suggested that because cats are carnivores they had no evolutionary need to develop systems that metabolized the phytoalexins, a group of compounds found in cruciferous plants. The clinical consequence of this is two-fold: toxic side effects may occur if doses and dosing intervals are not adjusted, or alternatively, if the parent compound is metabolized to an active component via this pathway, for example morphine, the drug may be less effective. The cat\u2019s susceptibility to toxic side effects of phenolic drugs such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) and the long half-life of aspirin can be explained by the deficient glucuronidation pathway. Because of their unique metabolism, there are few non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs licensed for use in cats and none have market authorization for long-term use as is the case for dogs. For these reasons it makes sense to focus efforts on the study of other analgesic drug classes in cats, including the opioids. Opioids - General Overview Because of their efficacy, good safety margin and versatility, opioids comprise the backbone of acute pain management in most species including humans. The use of alfentanil, butorphanol, buprenorphine, fentanyl, meperidine (pethidine), methadone, morphine, nalbuphine, hydromorphone and oxymorphone have been reported in cats. A comprehensive review of opioid pharmacology is outside the scope of this chapter", "2": "and for this information, the reader is referred to classic textbooks [8]. Briefly, butorphanol is classified as an agonist-antagonist which has a ceiling effect, buprenorphine as a partial agonist and the others are classified as opioid agonists. The opioid agonists have a linear dose-response and can be titrated to effect. Buprenorphine behaves clinically like an opioid agonist and the so-called \"bell shaped\" curve is not seen at clinically useful doses [9]. The lethal dose of individual opioids is not well documented in the cat, but in the rat the median lethal dose of morphine is 64 mg/kg and for buprenorphine it is 234 mg [10] which is 32 and over 4000 times the recommended analgesic dose, respectively. The safety of opioids is also enhanced by their reversibility with opioids antagonist drugs such as naloxone or naltrexone. Evaluation of Opioids in the Cat Opioids have been studied in the clinical arena and in research settings. Although our aim is to confirm which opioids, doses and routes of administration are effective in cats with clinical pain, this is confounded by our ability, or perhaps inability to assess pain in cats. There is no validated pain scoring tool available for cats and as in all animals our evaluation of their pain is subjective and based on behavioral changes. Many scoring systems have been used [11] but because of inter-observer variability and use of different systems it is difficult to compare clinical studies. In the laboratory setting, opioids have been studied in cats using various noxious stimulus models and measuring changes in the threshold to the stimulus before and after drug administration. Although this is a measure of antinociception and these stimuli are not the same as clinical pain, these studies have been useful for measuring onset time, intensity and duration of antinociception produced", "3": "by opioids and has also been used to study the effects of various routes of drug administration. The models used include thermal [12], mechanical [13], electrical [14,15] and visceral [16] stimulation. Another method has been the measurement of the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of inhalant anesthetic agents. This is an indirect method the basis of which is the assumption that because the technique involves a noxious stimulus (electrical or mechanical) applied to the anesthetized animal, a reduction in MAC after administering a putative analgesic supports its efficacy. This method has been used to evaluate bolus doses of opioids [17], opioid infusions [18] and epidural administration of opioids [19] in cats. Compared to the dog, MAC is reduced less in cats by most opioids and it does not appear to be dose related; for example, the same dose of morphine administered to dogs and cats reduced the MAC of isoflurane approximately 50% and 28%, respectively [17]. Side-effects of Opioids It is a misconception that all opioids cause excitement or so-called \"morphine mania\" in cats. Unfortunately, this fear of excitement has been one of the reasons practitioners have historically been reluctant to use opioids in cats. Such reports were based on early literature when excessive doses (e.g., 20 mg/kg of morphine) were administered [20,21]. Recent studies show that with appropriate dosing, the behavioral effects usually include euphoria, with purring, rolling, and kneading with the front paws [22]. One exception is butorphanolwhich has been associated with dysphoric behavior [23]. An elevated body temperature is a concern in a sick or injured cat as the cause may be infection, administration of certain drugs or overzealous warming and the cause must be identified so that the correct treatment can be started and the adverse effects of hyperthermia prevented. The practitioner should be aware of opioid", "4": "related hyperthermia in cats. At doses of morphine > 1.0 mg/kg cats may become hyperthermic [24] and pethidine (meperidine) at 3 times clinically recommended doses resulted in temperatures as high as 41.7\u00b0C (107\u00b0F) [25]. Alfentanil infusions in anesthetized cats resulted in significantly elevated rectal temperatures [18]. This phenomenon appears to be dose related, but even at commonly used clinical doses some opioids may result in elevated body temperature. In a retrospective clinical study [26] there was a strong association between the use of hydromorphone (at 0.05 - 1.0 mg/kg, IM or IV on one or more occasions) and hyperthermia (defined as a rectal temperature > 40\u00b0C, 104\u00b0F). Rectal temperatures over 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F) were recorded in 75% of the cats that received hydromorphone and a peak temperature of 42.5\u00b0C (108.5\u00b0F) occurred in one cat. In a research setting, hydromorphone at 0.1 mg/kg IV was associated with a significant increase in skin temperature [27] whereas 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg were not. In a prospective clinical study [28] Posner and others also concluded that hydromorphone was implicated in peri-anesthetic hyperthermia in feline patients although it may occur with other drugs. Cats given hydromorphone should have their body temperature closely monitored [27,28]. In a clinical study of cats undergoing onychectomy, those treated with a transdermal fentanylpatch had higher rectal temperatures than those given butorphanol [29]. Opioids cause marked mydriasis in cats and this may cause them to bump into objects and they may not see a handler approaching (Figure 1). For these reasons approach slowly, while talking to the cat so it is not startled. Also keep them out of bright light while their pupils are dilated. Figure 1. Unlike in many other species, opioids produce mydriasis rather than miosis in cats. Vomiting and salivation (which suggests nausea) are seen after morphine and hydromorphone", "5": "injection, but is uncommon after butorphanol, buprenorphine, meperidine or methadone [12,30,31]. The incidence of nausea and vomiting is also related to the route of administration; subcutaneous hydromorphone results in a higher incidence of vomiting than the intravenous or intramuscular route [31]. When administered to painful cats or in combination with acepromazine the incidence of opioid-induced vomiting is considerably less. The effects on bowel function of pain itself and of analgesics and sedatives used clinically must be considered. Pain can cause bowel stasis, abdominal distension, discomfort and vomiting, all of which add to a patient\u2019s overall misery. Analgesic intervention often results in a dramatic improvement but opioids are known to decrease bowel motility especially with long-term use. Intramuscular acepromazine (0.1 mg/kg) combined with buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg), or medetomidine (50 \u00b5g/kg) alone provided good restraint without altering orocaecal transit time in cats whereas ketamine (5 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) did decrease gastrointestinal motility [32]. The use of transdermal fentanyl patches has not sparked comments about constipation, and transdermal buprenorphine patches (discussed later) did not affect food intake or frequency of bowel movements in a group of research cats. However, systemic treatment (transmucosal, IV, IM or SQ) with buprenorphine at doses of 0.01 - 0.02 mg/kg can cause inappetence in some cats after 2-3 days, which often resolves when the dose is reduced or the drug withdrawn (author\u2019s own observations). The effects of opioids on bowel function may be both dose and duration related, but there is little scientific data available for cats. Individual Variation Individual variability in the antinociceptive effects of opioids has been demonstrated in many species and this variability appears to be multifactorial, with gender, genotype, and type of noxious stimulus affecting an individual\u2019s response. It is now apparent that individuals are unique with respect to number, morphology, and", "6": "distribution of opioid receptors and that these differences are genetically determined [33]. It is likely that genetics affect both the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of opioids through alterations in uptake, biotransformation, transport, elimination, and receptor interaction [34,35]. Klepstad and others [36] discussed that even for one drug (morphine), genetic variability in patient response is multifactorial and involves genes that code for the enzymes that metabolize morphine, mu- opioid receptors and blood-brain barrier transporters. Pharmacogenetics is an increasingly important emerging area of research related to analgesia. Mice and humans with non-functional melanocortin-1 receptors encoded by the MC1R gene have an increased analgesic responsiveness to the OP3 opioid selective metabolite, morphine-6-glucuronide [37,38]. The morphology and sequencing of feline opioid receptors has not been extensively studied compared to other species [39], but in controlled research environments marked variation in analgesic response to opioids has been reported suggesting that cats also express genetic variability. In two independent studies of butorphanol in cats using a thermal stimulus to assess antinociception, investigators demonstrated significant inter-cat differences. In the first study, one cat had a pronounced and prolonged antinociceptive response while another had a response that was not significantly different from pretreatment when given 0.4 mg/kg butorphanol intravenously [23]. Similar findings were demonstrated with the administration of intramuscular butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg) in an unrelated group of cats; one cat had a significant elevation in thermal threshold lasting from 50 minutes until 8 hours, while another showed minimal response to the same treatment [40]. Individual variability in response to butorphanol was also noted in a visceral nociception model, where duration of effect varied from 0 to at least 360 minutes in individual cats [15]. Even in the same laboratory, using the same equipment and investigators, the duration of effect of intravenous hydromorphone was significantly different in two separate groups", "7": "of cats [27,41]. This underscores the importance of carefully assessing pain in cats since one analgesic at a set dose is unlikely to be equally effective in all patients. Dose Related Effects In the literature, wide ranges of doses of opioids are often suggested with little foundation [42]. The effect of dose on onset, duration and intensity of effect is difficult to compare between studies, even laboratory-based studies because of the individual variation between cats as previously discussed. Two randomized cross over dose-response studies using a thermal threshold model have been published. In both, the intravenous route of administration was used to minimize any differences in absorption, uptake, distribution or metabolism between cats. The first study examined doses of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg of butorphanol [23]. Results indicated that the duration of the antinociceptive action of butorphanol was 90 minutes and there was no dose-response relationship in cats, supporting the assumption that butorphanol is an agonist- antagonist opioid and rapidly reaches a ceiling effect. Wegner and Robertson [27] concluded that doses of hydromorphone less than 0.1 mg/kg have a minimal effect and that perhaps a critical number of opioids receptors must be occupied before a response is measurable. It is not known if the response to doses over 0.1 mg/kg are dose-related or linear because the authors thought that higher doses are unlikely to be clinically useful because of the high incidence of hyperthermia related to this drug and therefore were not pursued. Whether or not the intensity or duration of effect of other opioids is dose-related is uncertain. p Routes of Administration Intravenous, Intramuscular and Subcutaneous Administration In a hospital setting the intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous routes of administration are most commonly used. In cats, studies comparing the administration of opioids given by the intravenous and intramuscular", "8": "routes have been reported [43] and demonstrate that the route of administration does influence pharmacokinetic variables. However, what we are most interested in is the pharmacodynamic effect of opioids and with respect to the route of administration this has not been extensively studied in cats. The subcutaneous route is attractive in cats as it is simpler than an IV injection and less painful than an IM injection. The route of administration of hydromorphone affects the onset time, intensity of effect and duration of antinociceptive effects and also the incidence of nausea and vomiting [31]; see later under specific opioids / hydromorphone. Oral Administration Administering pills orally to cats is notoriously difficult and in most species oral administration of opioids results in greatly reduced plasma levels because of \"first-pass\" hepatic metabolism. For these reasons, the oral route of administration of opioids has not received much attention. Transdermal Delivery Systems There has been great interest in transdermal delivery of drugs because they may offer a \"hands off\" approach to pain management and could provide a constant delivery of drug thereby avoiding peaks and troughs seen with intermittent bolus administration. In addition, these systems are more attractive for cats that are difficult to handle. Both fentanyl and buprenorphine are available in a transdermal patch formulation and are discussed later. Despite their widespread use and promotion by compounding pharmacies, transdermal formulations of creams designed to be rubbed into the skin of cats cannot be scientifically supported [44]. Transmucosal Uptake of Opioids Because of the limitations of the oral route, transmucosal administration of opioids has been investigated. Based on reports of the efficacy of transmucosal uptake of buprenorphine in humans, studies in cats were conducted and showed almost 100% bioavailability of the injectable formulation when placed on oral mucus membranes [45,46]. In addition, the transmucosal", "9": "route was found to be well tolerated and as effective as the intravenous route when assessed using a thermal threshold model [46]. There was absorption of fentanyl from the oral cavity in cats but administration was associated with profuse salivation and resentment by the cats [44]. Transmucosal uptake of other opioids has not been reported in cats. Epidural Administration Morphine (0.1 mg/kg), buprenorphine (12.5 \u00b5g/kg), fentanyl (4 \u00b5g/kg), meperidine (pethidine) and methadone have been administered via the epidural route in cats [14,19,47-52]. Epidural buprenorphine did not decrease the minimum alveolar concentration (an indirect measure of analgesia or antinociception) of isoflurane [19]. In a clinical setting, morphine has been thought to be the most clinically useful epidural opioid in terms of analgesia achieved, duration of action and lack of side effects; although in one study 2 out of 23 cats that received epidural morphine had urinary retention [51]. In a laboratory based study, fentanyl only resulted in an increase in pain threshold at the 20 minute test point [14]. In a previous research-based study, epidural morphine was thought to be an effective analgesic [48] but more recently, Pypendop and others [19] have critically re-evaluated the effects of epidural morphine in cats and reported that it did not cause a decrease in the MAC of isoflurane. Interestingly, epidural morphine resulted in a significant decrease in the MAC of halothane in dogs when the noxious stimulus was applied to both the fore- and hindlimbs [53]. Whether this disparity is due to differences in experimental technique, a species specific effect or a reflection of individual variation in response to opioids as previously discussed is unknown and warrants further study. Specific Opioids Butorphanol Butorphanol is a mu-antagonist, which produces analgesia through its kappa agonist activity. It is commonly used in cats in North America, and", "10": "is generally given at doses from 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg [54]. More recently its analgesic properties have been called into question in both dogs and cats [55]. Butorphanol exhibits a \"ceiling\" effect after which increasing the doses does not produce any further analgesia [23]; after IV administration there was no significant differences in thermal antinociception produced with 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 or 0.8 mg/kg. Butorphanol appears to be an effective visceral, but poor somatic analgesic [15]. In an experimental visceral pain model (rectal distension with a balloon) Sawyer and Rech reported that the most effective IV dose of butorphanol was 0.1 mg/kg which produced analgesia for 350 \u00b1 10 minutes and the most effective SQ dose was 0.4 mg/kg which resulted in 298 \u00b1 45 minutes of analgesia [15]. The same authors could only demonstrate somatic antinociception after high doses of intravenous butorphanol. Both clinical impressions and experimental investigations indicate that butorphanol is short acting (< 90 minutes) [23,30,55] and requires frequent dosing to be effective. Recent data suggests that 0.2 mg/kg given by the intramuscular route may be more effective in cats [40], but there is no pharmacokinetic data comparing IV and IM dosing in cats to explain this difference; those authors concluded that it was difficult to compare studies and that individual variation in response may have accounted for the results they reported. Butorphanol appears to be is a poor analgesic choice in the face of both somatic and visceral pain, but would be a reasonable choice for acute visceral pain such as that associated with acute cystitis, or enteritis. Buprenorphine Buprenorphine is the most popular opioid used in small animals practice in the UK [56] where it now has market authorization for use in cats and is also widely used in the rest of Europe, Australia and South", "11": "Africa [57,58]. In research cats it has been studied after IM, IV and oral transmucosal (OTM) [30,40,45,46] administration. Intramuscular doses of 0.01 mg/kg resulted in a slow onset (2 hours) of analgesia with a variable duration ranging from 4 to 12 hours [30]. At a dose of 0.02 mg/kg IM the thermal threshold was significantly increased from 35 minutes to 5 hours after treatment [40]. Systemic uptake of buprenorphine after oral transmucosal dosing is almost 100% complete [45,46] in cats. The pH of the cat\u2019s mouth is between 8 and 9 which would enhance absorption and this may explain the effectiveness of this route in cats compared to other species with a neutral oral pH [45]. There was no difference in onset of analgesia (within 30 minutes), time to peak effect (90 minutes), or duration of action (6 hours) when 0.02 mg/kg was administered by the IV or OTM route in research cats [46]. In clinical studies, buprenorphine produced better analgesia than morphine in cats undergoing a variety of soft tissue and orthopedic procedures [59], was superior to oxymorphone for sterilization (with or without onychectomy) [60], and provided longer pain relief than meperidine (pethidine) following ovariohysterectomy [61]. Buprenorphine rarely causes vomiting or dysphoria and has not been associated with hyperthermia [26]. A transdermal (matrix patch) delivery system for buprenorphine is now available for use in humans. In cats, there was systemic uptake after application of a 35\u00b5g/hour patch but plasma concentrations were quite variable, and over a 4 day period, no effective analgesia was demonstrated [62]. Fentanyl Fentanyl is a potent, short acting pure mu agonist which is commonly used clinically as a constant rate infusion [CRI] [63] although there is no published data on the pharmacokinetic profile of fentanyl over time when administered in this fashion to cats. In", "12": "a cat specific study 10 \u00b5g/kg (IV) provided rapid onset (peak action < 5 minutes) of significant analgesia that lasted 110 minutes, with no excitement, salivation or vomiting [44]. In that study, plasma fentanyl concentrations and analgesia were closely correlated and it was concluded that at a plasma value of > 1.07 ng/ml fentanyl provides analgesia, which is similar to that reported for dogs [64] and humans [65]. This data should be the basis of formulating more rational constant rate infusion and target controlled infusion protocols for cats. Transdermal fentanyl (TDF) patches have been used for acute peri-operative pain in cats [29,66,67]. Plasma fentanyl concentrations are variable in cats after patch placement [29,66], and in one study [68], 2 out of 6 cats never achieved plasma fentanyl concentrations above 1 ng/ml. Factors affecting plasma levels include the size of the patch compared to the weight of the cat, skin permeability, and body temperature. In critical care patients, hypothermia, hypovolemia, and diminished skin perfusion will decrease absorption. In normothermic (38\u00b0C) cats, mean serum levels were 1.83 \u00b1 0.63 ng/ml compared to 0.59 \u00b1 0.30 ng/ml in hypothermic (35\u00b0C) animals [69]. In cats weighing < 4kg, placement of a 25\u00b5g/h patch with full exposure of the adhesive layer resulted in a steady state plasma concentration of 1.78 \u00b1 0.92 ng/ml compared to 1.14 \u00b1 0.86 ng/ml when only one half of the adhesive was exposed [70]. In general, cats achieve steady state plasma concentration within 6-12 hours after patch placement [71] and this persists for up to 18-20 hours [68] after removal. During the uptake phase other opioids must be administered to provide analgesia and all except butorphanol, which may antagonize fentanyl, could be used. TDF patches have proved useful in a clinical setting [29,66,67]. The use of various drugs compounded in", "13": "transdermal creams has become popular in veterinary medicine despite the lack of scientific studies [72]. Fentanyl compounded in pluronic lecithin organogel failed to be absorbed through the skin of the inner pinna or dorsum of the shaved neck of cats even after a dose of 30 \u00b5g/kg, therefore these formulations cannot be recommended [44]. Hydromorphone Hydromorphone has become popular in veterinary medicine and has to a great extent replaced oxymorphone because it is less expensive [42]. Doses of 0.05-0.2 mg/kg of hydromorphone are generally recommended [42]. The relationship between dose and thermal antinociception (a measure of analgesia) following intravenous hydromorphone administration has been studied in cats. At doses of 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg there was a small increase in thermal antinociception of short duration [27]. An intravenous dose of 0.1 mg/kg produced a substantial increase in thermal antinociception for up to 7 hours [27,73]. Route of administration has a significant effect on quality and duration of analgesia and side effects. When the analgesic and side-effects of 0.1 mg/kg given by the intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous route were compared, the intravenous route produced the greatest intensity and duration of antinociceptive effect with the least incidence of vomiting and salivation [31]. The incidence of hyperthermia associated with the use of hydromorphone in cats [26,28] as discussed previously in this chapter has limited its use by some veterinarians in clinical practice. In contrast to the study by Briggs et al which studied the combination of oxymorphone and butorphanol [16], a combination of hydromorphone (0.1 mg/kg IM) and butorphanol (0.4 mg/kg IM) did not have additive effects on thermal antinociception, but rather produced a longer lasting (up to 9 hours) but less intense effect than hydromorphone alone [74]. Meperidine (Pethidine) Meperidine is only given by the intramuscular or subcutaneous route due to reports of", "14": "excitement after intravenous dosing. In clinical studies (3.3-10 mg/kg IM) it appears to be effective and has a fast onset but short duration of action [75,76]. Research studies suggest that at a dose of 5 mg/kg its duration of action is less than one hour [12]. Methadone Methadone is a synthetic opioid agonist but also has considerable activity as an N-methyl-D- aspartate antagonist. It is widely used to manage cancer pain and \"difficult\" pain syndromes such as neuropathic-type pain with considerable success in humans [77,78]. In humans this drug is unusual in that it has good oral bioavailability and a long elimination half-life making it convenient for \"at-home\" use. In dogs, the pharmacokinetic profile of methadone was quite different from humans, with low oral bioavailability, rapid clearance and short elimination half- life [78]. The pharmacokinetics of this drug has not been reported in cats. Methadone is used widely in the clinical setting, particularly in Europe. Racemic methadone has been evaluated in cats in a research setting [80], and both it and levo-methadone have been assessed peri-operatively in clinical cases [81,82]. In one study, 0.2 mg/kg of methadone given SQ increased the thermal threshold at 1 to 3 hours and the mechanical threshold from 45-60 minutes after administration [80]. Other doses and routes of administration have not been studied with this model. Racemic methadone (0.6 mg/kg IM) and levo-methadone (0.3 mg/kg IM) given pre-operatively provided effective analgesia as judged by assessment of behavior and palpation of the wound in cats after ovariectomy and without behavioral, respiratory or cardiovascular side-effects [81]. Levo-methadone (0.3 mg/kg every 8 hours for 5 days, beginning at extubation) was not as effective as carprofen or buprenorphine in cats after major orthopedic surgery and was associated with excitement in some cats [82]. Morphine Morphine has been widely used", "15": "in cats and doses of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg are effective in clinical cases and do not cause excitement [83]. Both clinically [83] and in research models [30] onset of action is slow. Morphine appears less effective in cats compared to dogs and this may be related to their limited production of the active morphine metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide (M-6-G) [43] which may contribute significantly to morphine\u2019s overall analgesic effect in humans [84]. M-6-G could only be detected in 3 of 6 cats after IV administration and was not measurable after IM dosing [43]. It may be that higher doses of morphine are required in cats because of the primary dependence on the parent compound to produce analgesia. Nalbuphine Nalbuphine is classified as an opioid agonist-antagonist and although it was popular in the past it is not widely used in cats today. Using an electrical stimulus to evaluate somatic antinociception, Sawyer and Rech [15] could not demonstrate any effects at doses ranging from 0.75 to 1.5 mg/kg IV. They were able to demonstrate a dose-related effect on visceral pain thresholds; 3.0 mg/kg IV had a duration effect of 180 \u00b1 39 minutes, which was shorter than that produced by butorphanol, another agonist-antagonist used in their study. Oxymorphone Oxymorphone has been a popular analgesic for many years in the USA [60,86]. Using a visceral pain model, Briggs and others [16] reported that a combination of oxymorphone and butorphanol produced a greater degree of analgesia than either drug used alone and that this could be further enhanced by adding acepromazine. Clinically oxymorphone does not appear to be associated with hyperthermia, vomiting and nausea or adverse behavioral effects. Tramadol Although not classified as an opioid, tramadol has weak binding affinity at mu-receptors and is thought to activate monoaminergic spinal inhibition of pain. When used clinically in cats", "16": "the effects of tramadol can be quite pronounced, including euphoria, dilated pupils and sedation (author\u2019s personal observations). The opioid actions of tramadol in cats may be more pronounced than in other species: in anesthetized cats, naloxone completely reversed the inhibiting effects of tramadol on ventilatory control and prevented more than 50% of the respiratory depression following 4 mg/kg IV [86]. There is no published pharmacokinetic data for tramadol in cats and species-specific data is required because metabolism in dogs was different compared to humans [87], therefore extrapolation from existing data is unwise. In dogs this drug shows promise for acute pain [88], but in a small group of research cats 1 mg/kg (SQ) did not produce thermal or mechanical antinociception [89]. A dose of 1-2 mg/kg IV has been suggested for clinical use in cats, but there are as yet no published reports of controlled clinical studies.

The rationale behind these studies is to", "17": "combine the attributes of each drug in the combination and minimize the side- effects of each. Multiple combinations are possible given the dose range of each drug. However, the results of the above combinations were quite different and may be a result of actual drug effects or the doses of each used. Low doses of oxymorphone and butorphanol in combination produced greater levels of antinociception than when used individually [16]. The addition of butorphanol (0.4 mg/kg IM) to hydromorphone (0.1 mg/kg IM) decreased the intensity of antinociception during the first 2 hours but extended the duration of observable antinociception from 5.75 to 9 hours [74]. A combination of 0.2 mg/kg IM of butorphanol and 0.02 mg/kg IM of buprenorphine had no demonstrable advantages over either drug used alone [40].

Not a controlled IV formulation n **The human product Ultracet \u00ae contains acetaminophen and must not be used in cats Fentanyl, alfentanil, sufentanil and remifentanil are used as infusions in humans and several domestic species. Constant rate infusions are used as part of a balanced anesthetic protocol, either with other injectable agents such as propofol, or with inhalant agents. They are also used post-operatively or in trauma patients to provide continuous analgesia and avoid the peaks and troughs and break-through pain associated with intermittent bolus administration. Fentanyl is the drug used most often in a clinical setting yet there is no data on the influence of inhalant anesthetics or propofol on its metabolism in cats. Used as a constant rate infusion over several hours accumulation may occur and clinically delayed recoveries are seen (author\u2019s own observation). Ideally, target controlled infusion rates based on pharmacokinetic", "18": "data derived following bolus administration in cats [44] should be used, but as of yet this information is not available. In a prospective randomized study of injured cats, it was concluded that fentanyl (CRI of 0.02 mg/kg/hour) and propofol (12 mg/kg/hour) provided better cardiovascular stability than isoflurane and fentanyl but required intermittent positive pressure ventilation to maintain end- tidal CO2 values < 50 mmHg [90]. Target controlled infusions of alfentanil have been studied in isoflurane anesthetized research cats [18], but was not as effective at reducing MAC as in dogs, and was associated with an increase in rectal temperature, metabolic acidosis, decrease in PaO2 and excitement during recovery if the cats were handled. Combinations of propofol with fentanyl, alfentanil or sufentanil provided satisfactory anesthesia in a research setting using a noxious stimulus to evaluate depth of anesthesia [91]. Although it is not possible to compare infusion rates of alfentanil between the study by Ilkiw and others [18] and Mendes and Selmi [91] because of different methodologies, the latter authors reported hypothermia and not hyperthermia. There are no published studies on the use of remifentanil infusions in cats, but based on its pharmacologic profile and studies in humans and other species it deserves exploration. Long-term Use of Opioids Because of the potential adverse side-effects of long-term non-steroidal anti-inflammatory administration in cats, it would be ideal if opioids could be used to manage chronic pain. Very little is known about long-term use of opioids in cats, including the issue of dependency. In this author\u2019s experience, cats frequently become inappetent after 2-3 days of opioid treatment and this may be a result of decreased gastrointestinal motility. In addition the side- effects of euphoria and dilated pupils can be problematic. However, further work is warranted to look at the efficacy of drugs such as", "19": "oral tramadol and methadone for long-term pain management or different dosing regimens, formulation or routes of administration of opioids that are effective for acute pain. The use of opioid antagonists that work only at peripheral sites to antagonize undesirable systemic effects but not centrally mediated analgesia show great promise in humans [92] but have not been widely explored in veterinary medicine. Summary The days of avoiding opioids in cats for the treatment of clinical pain because of unsubstantiated reports of excitatory effects are behind us. Although some effects of opioids seem unique to cats, there has been considerable work conducted specifically on opioids in cats in the past decade and the drugs, routes of administration and doses used today have a scientific basis. There is still much to be learned about the chronic use of opioids in cats and the development of target controlled infusions hold promise as part of balanced general anesthetic protocols. Clinical Practice Review Assessment and management of acute pain in cats Sheilah A. Robertson, BVMS (Hons), PhD, DACVA Abstract: Cats are popular pets, but until recently, their peri-operative and traumatic pain had been seriously underestimated and under-treated. The lack of treatment stems from dif\ufb01culty in recognizing pain, lack of licensed analgesic drugs, fear of toxic side effects, and lack of information specific to cats. Fortunately, in the last decade, many advances have been made in feline analgesia. It is now obvious that because of the cat\u2019s unique metabolism, species-specific studies are essential. Opioids are the mainstay of any analgesic protocol for acute pain and can be used with few side effects. Other drugs that can be utilized include the a2-agonists, local anesthetics, and non-steroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs. Pain assessment in cats is challenging and developing, and validating pain scoring systems remains an important goal. The information in", "20": "this article will help the critical care and emergency clinician formulate a safe and effective analgesic plan for feline patients.

Of note is that cats recently overtook dogs as the most popular pet with current numbers estimated at between 70 and 77.7 million in the United States alone. Concur- rent with this has been a long awaited increase in the publication of studies relevant to assessment and alle- viation of pain in this species which has previously lagged behind the information available for dogs. How- ever, feline practitioners are still faced with several challenges including the cat\u2019s unique metabolism of many drugs and the lack of licensed analgesic drugs. In the \ufb01eld of emergency medicine, the veterinarian will deal primarily with acute pain that may be related to trauma, non-elective surgical procedures, or medical diseases. Acute pain has a wide variety of causes and sources (soft tissue, orthopedic, ocular, somatic, viscer- al), variable intensity (from minor lacerations to mul- tiple fractures, acute peritonitis, or pancreatitis), and expected duration (days to weeks), which may all re- quire a different approach to treatment. The aim of this paper is to review current knowledge of acute pain assessment in cats, and the most useful drugs and techniques for its alleviation. What Is Pain and How Do We Measure It? Pain is a complex, multidimensional experience in- volving both sensory and affective components. All mammals possess the neuroanatomic and neurophar- macologic components necessary for transduction, transmission, and", "21": "perception of noxious stimuli (no- ciception). A recent consensus statement indicated that animals are capable of emotions and, therefore, do ex- perience pain, although it is unclear whether all species, including humans, feel pain with the same qualities and intensities.2 Cats are under-treated for pain.3\u20136 When veterinari- ans were asked their opinion on an exploratory laparo- tomy in dogs and cats, they considered this procedure equally painful in both species, yet only 56% of cats received analgesics compared with 71% of dogs.5 To overcome this bias, we must understand why cats come in second in the pain stakes. The reason for under- treating feline pain is not lack of compassion by care- givers. The most often cited reasons for withholding analgesics from cats are dif\ufb01culty in recognizing and assessing pain, the limited number of analgesics with market authorization, lack of published information, and the fear of adverse side effects.5 Address correspondence and reprint requests to: Sheilah A.

In 2003, the American Animal Hospital Association introduced pain management standards that must be met for ac- creditation and a mandate is that pain must be assessed in all patients regardless of the presenting problem. This is one of the biggest challenges feline practitioners face. We must know \ufb01rst if they do indeed hurt and, if so, how much. To assess pain in animals, we must ob- serve", "22": "them carefully and know what behaviors indicate pain; by definition, this is subjective and, compared with humans and young children who can communi- cate, there is more room for error. Put simply, in hu- mans, pain is what the patient says it is and in animals it is what we decide it is. Currently, there is no gold standard for assessing pain in animals. The issue in animals is complex because we must consider differences in species-specific responses to pain, but even within a species there is considerable variation. Few veterinarians would disagree that the different temperaments of individual cats complicates the picture. Investigators looking for objective measure of pain have failed to \ufb01nd a good correlation between physiologic variables (respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure) or plasma cortisol levels and pain scores in cats because these are in\ufb02uenced by many factors other than pain.7\u20139 Changes in wound sensitivity have cor- related well with visual analog pain scores in cats10 suggesting that palpation, which is a simple clinically applicable technique, is a valuable tool and should be incorporated into an overall assessment protocol. In an emergency clinic, a pain scoring system must be simple and quick to perform, but be valid, reliable, and sensitive. Observation of behavior is undoubted- ly the best means of assessing the degree of pain ex- perienced by a cat11; however, in the emergency setting, the veterinarian may have had no prior contact with the cat and will require the owner\u2019s input on what is normal for that particular patient. More information can be gathered if you \ufb01rst observe the cat from a dis- tance, then assess its response to a person\u2019s approach, and \ufb01nally interact with it by stroking it and palpat- ing the wound or area you suspect is painful.7 Use of a dynamic", "23": "interactive visual analog scale (DIVAS) by one individual unaware of treatments detected both differences between 2 analgesics and between treated and untreated cats.12 Acute pain related to trau- ma may result in a depressed, immobile, and silent cat that is tense, distanced from its environment and that tries to hide and does not respond to stroking or atten- tion. Alternatively, cats can be manic and aggressive, growling, hissing, and rolling around their cage; these are dif\ufb01cult patients to assess and treat and are dis- cussed later. Cats with abdominal pain adopt a hunched sternal posture, with their head hung lower than their body, elbows drawn back, sti\ufb02es forward and abdominal muscles tensed. Cats may lick, chew, and self-mutilate an injured area and this is documented following on- ychectomy.13 If part of the treatment involves bandag- ing or taping, the observer must differentiate between pain and the dislike of restrictive dressings. Levy et al.14 reported that bandages alone caused a 200% increase in urine cortisol, suggesting that cats \ufb01nd this stressful. Cats that are comfortable can perform normal functions including stretching, back arching, climbing into a litter box, grooming and adopting normal postures such as laying curled up in lateral recumbency. Regardless of the scoring system adopted, it should become part of the routine assessment \u2013 temperature, pulse, respiration, and pain score (\u2018TPRP\u2019). Analgesic intervention should restore normal behavior and lower the pain score. Why Treat Pain? Treating pain has obvious welfare bene\ufb01ts but also many other less obvious dividends pertinent to trau- matized or critically ill cats. These include better car- diovascular stability, decreased metabolic and hormonal responses, and less catabolism and immuno- suppression.15 Surgical or accidental trauma results in primary (at the site of injury) and secondary (at sites distant to the injury) nociceptive sensitization that can lead to", "24": "prolonged and intensi\ufb01ed pain.16,17 The bene\ufb01ts of pre-emptive analgesia in limiting central sensitizat- ion and \u2018wind-up\u2019 has been a controversial topic in human medicine but can be demonstrated.18 In ani- mals, there is good evidence that this is a worthwhile strategy19,20 and data in cats are encouraging.21 In emergency practice, the patient is often not seen until already in pain, but early intervention is still bene\ufb01cial \u2013 the longer it takes before initiating an analgesic plan, the harder it becomes to achieve relief. Drug Strategies for Alleviating Acute Pain There are several factors to consider when choosing an analgesic drug for feline patients, including the unique metabolism of cats, availability of species-specific data including both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacody- namic pro\ufb01le of the drug, and also ease of administra- tion (Table 1). Hepatic metabolism Cats have a reputation for adverse drug reactions; some of these are warranted and others are not. Cats have a low capacity for hepatic glucuronidation of exogenou- & Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2005, doi: 10.1111/j.1476-4431.2005.00172.x 262 S.A. Robertson sly administered drugs which has a molecular genetic basis.22\u201324 Domestic cats have fewer hepatic UDP- glucuroninosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms, and muta- tions of UGT and pseudogenes have been identi\ufb01ed by cloning techniques. Exposure to plants that contain phytoalexins stimulate development of these pathways but cats have historically been obligate carnivores and this may, in part, explain the differences between spe- cies. These metabolic differences can lead to toxic side effects if doses and dosing intervals are not adjusted. In contrast, if the parent compound must be metabolized to an active component via this pathway, the drug may be less effective. De\ufb01cient glucuronidation pathways explain the cat\u2019s susceptibility to the adverse side ef- fects of phenolic drugs such as acetaminophen (para- cetamol) and long half lives of other", "25": "drugs such as carprofen25,26 and salicylates.26,27 Cats produce very small amounts of the active metabolite morphine-6- glucuronide (M-6-G) which contributes to the overall analgesic pro\ufb01le of morphine; this may explain why morphine seems less effective in cats compared with other species.28 Drugs The analgesic drugs that are most useful to the critical care and emergency clinician are the opioids, a2-ago- nists, and local anesthetics. The NMDA receptor an- tagonist, ketamine, has been used extensively in cats for chemical restraint but may also have analgesic actions. With care, the non-steroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also have a place for acute pain management. Table 1: Drugs that can be used in cats for the treatment of acute pain.

The lethal dose of individual opioids is not well documented in the cat, but in the rat, the median lethal dose of mor- phine is 64 mg/kg and for buprenorphine it is 234 mg,29 which is 32 and over 4000 times the recommended an- algesic dose, respectively. The safety of opioids is also enhanced by their reversibility with drugs such as naloxone or naltrexone. Butorphanol, buprenorphine, fentanyl, meperidine (pethidine), morphine, hydromor- phone, and oxymorphone have all been used clinically in cats.11,30 Butorphanol is classi\ufb01ed as", "27": "an agonist-an- tagonist (having a ceiling effect), buprenorphine as a partial agonist, and the others are opioid agonists. The opioid agonists have a linear dose\u2013response and can be titrated to effect. Buprenorphine behaves like an opioid agonist and the so-called \u2018bell-shaped\u2019 curve is not seen at clinical doses. It is a misconception that cats are at a high risk of excitement or \u2018morphine mania\u2019 following opioid administration. Such reports were based on ear- ly literature when excessive doses (20 mg/kg of mor- phine) were administered.31,32 Recent studies show that with appropriate dosing the behavioral effects usually include euphoria, with purring, rolling, and kneading with the front paws.33\u201336 One exception is butorphanol which has been associated with dysphoric behavior.37 An elevated body temperature is a concern in a sick or injured cat as the cause may be infection, administra- tion of certain drugs or overzealous warming and the cause must be identi\ufb01ed so that the correct treatment can be started. The practitioner should also be aware of opioid-related hyperthermia in cats. At doses of mor- phine 41 mg/kg, cats may become hyperthermic38 and meperidine at 3 times clinically recommended doses resulted in temperatures as high as 41.7 1C (107 1F).39 This phenomenon appears to be dose related, but even at commonly used clinical doses, some opioids may result in elevated body temperature. In a retrospective clinical study (Niedfeldt and Robertson, unpublished data), there was a strong association between the use of hydromorphone (at 0.05\u20131.0 mg/kg intramuscular [IM] or intravenous [IV]) and hyperthermia. Some of these cats had received only 1 dose, and others 2 or more. Rectal temperatures over 40 1C (104 1F) were recorded in 75% of the cats that received hydromorphone and a peak temperature of 42.5 1C (108.5 1F) occurred in 1 cat. Temperatures over 40.5 1C (105", "28": "1F) are cause for con- cern and may respond to external cooling such as fans and application of cool water to the fur. However, higher temperatures are potentially life- threatening and in the study by Niedfeldt (2004, unpublished), 2 cats were open-mouth breathing and panting with body temperatures over 41.5 1C (107 1F). These cats responded quickly to naloxone but this op- ioid antagonist also reverses the analgesic effects of hydromorphone. The high incidence of hyperthermia at clinical doses has greatly reduced the use of hydro- morphone in the author\u2019s clinical practice. Cats treated with a transdermal fentanyl (TDF) patch had higher rectal temperatures than those given but- orphanol.40 Opioids cause marked mydriasis in cats; this may cause them to bump into objects and they may not see a handler approaching. For these reasons, approach slowly while talking to the cat so it is not startled. Al- so, keep them out of bright light while their pupils are dilated. Nausea, vomiting, and salivation can be seen after morphine and hydromorphone injection but is un- common after buprenorphine, meperidine, or but- orphanol.33,34,41 The incidence of nausea and vomiting is also related to the route of administration; subcuta- neous (SQ) hydromorphone results in a higher inci- dence of vomiting than the IV or IM route.41 When administered to painful cats or in combination with acepromazine, the incidence of opioid-induced vomit- ing is considerably less. Specific opioids Butorphanol is a m antagonist, which produces analge- sia through its k agonist activity. It is commonly used in cats in North America, and is generally given at doses from 0.1 to 0.4 mg/kg.3 More recently, its analgesic properties have been called into question in both dogs and cats.42 Butorphanol exhibits a \u2018ceiling\u2019 effect after which increasing the dose does not produce any further analgesia.37,43 Butorphanol", "29": "appears to be an effective visceral, but poor somatic analgesic.43 Both clinical studies and experimental investigations indicate that butorphanol is short acting (o90 minutes)34,43 and re- quires frequent dosing to be effective. Butorphanol is a poor analgesic choice in the face of both somatic and visceral pain, but would be a reasonable choice for acute visceral pain such as that associated with acute cystitis or enteritis. Meperidine is only given by the IM or SQ route be- cause of reports of excitement after IV dosing. In clin- ical studies (3.3\u201310 mg/kg IM), it appears to have a fast onset but short duration of action12,44 and research studies suggest that at a dose of 5 mg/kg its duration of action is less that 1 hour.33 Morphine has been widely used in cats and doses of 0.1\u20130.2 mg/kg are effective in clinical cases and do not cause excitement.11 Both clinically11 and in research models34 onset of action is slow.

Robertson related to their limited production of the active morphine metabolites morphine-6-glucuronide45 which may contribute significantly to morphine\u2019s overall an- algesic effect in humans.46 Oxymorphone has been a popular analgesic for many years in the USA.35,47,48 Using a visceral pain model, Briggs et al.48 reported that a combination of oxymor- phone and butorphanol produced a greater degree of analgesia than either drug used alone and that this could be further enhanced by adding acepromazine. Clinically, oxymorphone does not appear to be associ- ated with hyperthermia and is effective for many dif- ferent types of pain with duration of effect of 2\u20134 hours. Hydromorphone has become popular in veterinary medicine and has, to a great extent, replaced oxymor- phone", "30": "because it is less expensive.49 Doses of 0.05\u2013 0.2 mg/kg of hydromorphone are generally recom- mended.49 The relationship between dose and thermal antinociception (a measure of analgesia) of IV hydro- morphone administration has been studied in cats. At doses of 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg there was a small in- crease in thermal antinociception of short duration [Robertson, unpublished observations]. An IV dose of 0.1 mg/kg produced a substantial increase in thermal antinociception for up to 7 hours.50 Route of adminis- tration has a significant effect on quality and duration of analgesia and side effects. When the analgesic and side effects of 0.1 mg/kg given by the IV, IM, or SQ route were compared, the IV route produced the great- est intensity and duration of antinociceptive effect with the least incidence of vomiting and salivation.41 In contrast to the study by Briggs et al.48 a combi- nation of hydromorphone (0.1 mg/kg IM) and but- orphanol (0.4 mg/kg IM) did not have additive effects on thermal antinociception, but rather produced a longer lasting (up to 9 hours) but less intense effect than hydromorphone alone.51 Buprenorphine is the most popular opioid used in small animals practice in the UK5 and is also widely used in the rest of Europe, Australia, and South Afri- ca.4,6 In research cats, it has been studied after IM,34 IV, and oral transmucosal (OTM)52 administration. IM dos- es of 0.01 mg/kg resulted in a slow onset (2 hours) of analgesia with a variable duration ranging from 4 to 12 hours.34 Systemic uptake of buprenorphine after OTM dosing is almost 100% complete53 in cats. The pH of the cat\u2019s mouth is between 8 and 9, which would enhance absorption, and this may explain the effectiveness of this route in cats compared with other species with a neutral oral pH.53 There", "31": "was no difference in onset of analgesia (within 30 minutes), time to peak effect (90 minutes) or duration of action (6 hours) when 0.02 mg/ kg was administered by the IV or OTM route in re- search cats.52 In clinical studies, buprenorphine produced better analgesia than morphine in cats undergoing a variety of soft tissue and orthopedic procedures,54 was superior to oxymorphone for sterilization (with or without on- ychectomy)35 and provided longer pain relief than me- peridine (pethidine) following ovariohysterectomy.55 Buprenorphine rarely causes vomiting or dysphoria and has not been associated with hyperthermia (Ni- edfeldt and Robertson, unpublished data). There is very little information in the veterinary lit- erature about the effect of organ dysfunction on the metabolism of opioids. In humans with severe renal impairment, the metabolism of buprenorphine follow- ing single dosing or infusions was little affected and although metabolite concentrations increased these are unlikely to have significant pharmacological actions.56 The effect of buprenorphine on gastrointestinal activity is discussed later. Fentanyl is a potent, short acting pure m agonist which is commonly used as a constant rate infusion (CRI).30 In a cat specific study, 10 mg/kg IV provided rapid onset (peak action o5 minutes) of significant an- algesia that lasted 110 minutes, with no excitement, salivation or vomiting.36 In that study, plasma fentanyl concentrations and analgesia were closely correlated and it was concluded that at a plasma value of 41.07 ng/mL fentanyl provides analgesia, which is similar to that reported for dogs57 and humans.58 This data should be the basis of formulating more rational CRI and target controlled infusion protocols for cats. Transdermal delivery systems In the critical care setting, there has been great interest in transdermal delivery of drugs because they may of- fer a \u2018hands off\u2019 approach to pain management and could provide a constant delivery", "32": "of drug thereby avoiding peaks and troughs seen with intermittent bolus administration. A transdermal (matrix patch) delivery system for buprenorphine is now available for use in humans (Transtec).a In cats, there is systemic uptake after ap- plication of a 35 mg/h patch but plasma concentrations were very variable and over a 4-day period, no effective analgesia was demonstrated.59,60 The transdermal fentanyl (TDF) patch has been used for acute perioperative pain in cats.40,61,62 Plasma fent- anyl concentrations are variable after patch placement in cats40,61 and in one study,63 2 out of 6 cats never achieved plasma fentanyl concentrations above 1 ng/mL. Factors affecting plasma levels include the size of the patch compared with the weight of the cat, skin permeability, and body temperature. In critical care patients, hypo- thermia, hypovolemia, and decreased skin perfusion will decrease absorption.

During the uptake phase, other opioids must be administered to provide analgesia and all, except butorphanol, could be used. TDF patches have proved useful in a clinical setting.40,61,62 The use of various drugs compounded in transdermal creams has become popular in veterinary medicine de- spite the lack of scientific studies.67 Fentanyl compound- ed", "33": "in pluronic lecithin organogel failed to be absorbed through the skin of the inner pinna or dorsum of the shaved neck of cats even after a dose of 30 mg/kg, there- fore, these formulations cannot be recommended.36 Although not classi\ufb01ed as an opioid, tramadol has weak binding af\ufb01nity at m-receptors and is thought to activate monoaminergic spinal inhibition of pain. In dogs, this drug shows promise for acute pain.68 A dose of 1\u20132 mg/kg IV has been suggested for cats, but there are as yet no published reports of controlled clinical studies. The morphology and sequencing of feline opioid re- ceptors has not been extensively studied69 but marked inter-cat variation in analgesic response to butorphanol has been reported37 suggesting that cats also express genetic variability. This highlights the importance of careful assessment of pain in cats as one analgesic at a set dose is unlikely to be equally effective in all patients even with the same injury. a2-adrenoceptor agonists Medetomidine is not licensed for use in cats in the USA but is in several other countries. Medetomidine pro- vides dose-related sedation, muscle relaxation, and an- algesia in cats70 and can be excellent in an emergency setting as it provides reliable sedation and will allow the clinician to perform a clinical examination, take ra- diographs and perform minor procedures such as bandaging and jugular catheter placement. However, the main concern with its use in a critical care setting is its cardiovascular effects. Although doses of between 40 and 150 mg/kg have been recommended, clinical experience shows that 20 mg/kg IM provides reliable sedation and analgesia for up to 1 hour. However, even this lower dose causes a significant decrease in cardiac output, stroke volume, and heart rate71 Bradycardia and decreased stroke vol- ume contribute to the decrease in cardiac output which", "34": "is substantial, dropping from a mean of 1.3 to 0.49 L/ min 15 minutes after treatment; this is accompanied by a 3-fold increase in systemic vascular resistance.71 At 10 mg/kg IM, medetomidine caused a drop in ejection fraction from a mean of 55 to 43% and a 25% decrease in peak ventricular \ufb01lling rate.72 Some authors have cau- tioned against the use of medetomidine in cats with cardiac disease,72 whereas others have suggested it may be bene\ufb01cial in cats with left ventricular hypertrophy and out\ufb02ow obstruction.73 In human medicine, there is great interest in the use of a2-agonists where low doses of dexmedetomidine have provided excellent sedation, reduced opioid require- ments and maintained respiratory and cardiovascular stability in intensive care settings.74 Dexmedetomidine usage has been reported in cats, and combined with ketamine or butorphanol, minimal cardiovascular effects were reported75 but because of expense, this drug is not widely used clinically. The future success of medetomidine in veterinary clinical practice lies with the use of so-called \u2018micro- doses\u2019 in the range of 1\u20135 mg/kg (IVor IM)76 or as a CRI (1\u20132 mg/kg/hour) with or without opioids but critical evaluation of the cardiovascular effects of these proto- cols have not been undertaken in cats. The actions of medetomidine can be reversed with at- ipamezole76 and certainly the ability to antagonize po- tentially dangerous cardiovascular complications or inadvertent overdose is an advantage. However, in dogs, rapid reversal with IV atipamezole may induce hypo- tension,77 therefore, unless it is a life-threatening situa- tion, the IM route should be used or the dose can be given by slow (over 2\u20133 minutes) IV titration until the desired effect is achieved. This latter technique can be used to maintain mild sedation and analgesia. If mede- tomidine is used the patient\u2019s temperature should be monitored as hypothermia can", "35": "occur.76 Xylazine results in hypoinsulinemia and hyperglycemia and although the endocrine effects of medetomidine in the cat are not well documented it should be avoided in diabetic patients. Medetomidine induces vomiting in a high percentage of cats78 so should not be used when an increase in intra- ocular or intracranial pressure must be avoided. A fur- ther side effect of the a2-agonists is profound diuresis. Medetomidine is best reserved for use in previously healthy cats that require sedation following acute trau- ma, for example a fracture where blood loss is not an issue. Medetomidine should not be given to cats with cardiovascular disease, pre-existing hypovolemia, or head trauma. Local anesthetics Local anesthetics can be used for regional blockade (epidural analgesia), to block specific nerves (intercos- & Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2005, doi: 10.1111/j.1476-4431.2005.00172.x 266 S.A. Robertson tal, limbs), and in\ufb01ltrated into wounds or fractures (surgical or traumatic).30,79 The value of these tech- niques is underestimated in trauma and surgery pa- tients where they can provide complete analgesia with minimal side effects and whenever possible the clini- cian should use local anesthetics. Lamont30 offers a good review of techniques including brachial plexus block. A particularly useful technique is to implant a \u2018soaker\u2019 catheter into a wound (for example, large lac- eration, degloving injury, post-amputation wound) to provide a method for maintaining continuous analge- sia. Lidocaine (2\u20134 mg/kg) can be repeated every 2\u20133 hours or as needed based on wound palpation. Bupivacaine is longer acting and 2 mg/kg would be expected to last 4\u20135 hours. Both these drugs can be diluted with sterile saline to provide a suitable volume. Some authors recommend a combination of lidocaine plus bupivacaine to achieve a fast onset and longer duration of action; in this case the total dose of local anesthetic should not exceed", "36": "2 mg/kg. Topical anesthetic creams can be applied to shaved skin to provide analgesia for venipuncture, large-bore catheter placement, bone marrow aspiration or a vari- ety of other critical care procedures. The 2 commercially available agents are an over-the-counter liposome-en- capsulated formulation of lidocaine (ELA-Max s, LMXt)b and a prescription only mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine (EMLA s cream).c Transdermal absorp- tion did occur after application of 15 mg/kg of ELA- Max s, but plasma concentrations remained signi\ufb01cant- ly below toxic values.80 There was no systemic uptake of the components of EMLA s cream and its use sub- jectively eliminated the usual signs of discomfort seen with jugular catheter placement.81 In dogs, systemic lidocaine infusion has shown ben- e\ufb01cial effects as an analgesic in surgery patients82 and as an anesthetic sparing technique with no adverse cardiovascular effects.83,84 In cats, increasing plasma concentrations of lidocaine caused a dose-dependant decrease in iso\ufb02urane requirements.85 Despite a signif- icant reduction in the dose of inhalant agent, lidocaine produced more cardiovascular depression than an equipotent dose of iso\ufb02urane alone and was associat- ed with an increase in blood lactate concentration86 and, for these reasons, cannot be recommended in cats. This study emphasizes once again the importance of species-specific studies. Epidural drugs Opioids, a2-agonists, local anesthetics, or combinations of these drugs can be administered via the epidural route in cats. Opioids exert their major analgesic effect in the dor- sal horn of the spinal cord and intrathecal or epidural administration provides long lasting analgesia with fewer systemic side effects. Morphine (0.1 mg/kg), fentanyl (4 mg/kg), meperidine (pethidine), and meth- adone have been used successfully via the epidural route in cats87\u201392 with morphine being the most clini- cally useful in terms of analgesia achieved, duration of action and lack of side effects. In 1 study, 2 out", "37": "of 23 cats that received epidural morphine had urinary reten- tion.92 Lidocaine or bupivacaine are often co-adminis- tered with an opioid to enhance analgesia.30 Epidural administration of medetomidine (10 mg/kg) was found it to be superior to fentanyl (4 mg/kg)90 and systemic effects were mild and short lived.89 Epidural techniques may be an option for cats with tail, abdominal, pelvic or hind-limb pain, or that re- quire surgery at these sites. Opioids alone can provide good thoracic analgesia with minimal systemic effects. Epidural injection is technically more challenging in cats because of their small size and because the spinal cord ends more caudally; entering the subarachnoid space is more likely. If this occurs, half of the epidural dose may still be administered.30 Ketamine Ketamine is a non-competitive antagonist of the N-me- thyl-D-aspartate receptor that has been implicated in central sensitization. In human medicine, ketamine is being re-examined for its analgesic potential.93 In dogs, sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine (2.5 mg/kg) given preoperatively provided better postoperative analgesia than the same dose given at the end of surgery94 and low dose ketamine infusion in dogs after major surgery is opioid sparing.20 Ketamine is widely used in cats as a dissociative an- esthetic agent, but there is little information on its role as an analgesic. One study demonstrated a weak vis- ceral analgesic effect95 and anesthetic protocols that in- corporate ketamine provide better postoperative analgesia than those without.21 Low dose ketamine (2 mg/kg IV) produced excellent sedation in cats with an initial increase in thermal an- tinociception but after sedation had worn off there was a delayed onset of significant hyperalgesia or allodynia when even handling and stroking the cats prompted aversive behavior.96,97 It should be noted that in these studies cats did not undergo any painful procedures. Ketamine can only inhibit NMDA receptors", "38": "if they have been opened by a noxious stimulus98 and this may explain the difference between the use of ketamine to sedate pain-free cats compared with those in pain or undergoing surgery. The bene\ufb01ts of using low doses or infusions of ketamine in cats to alleviate pain warrants further study. & Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2005, doi: 10.1111/j.1476-4431.2005.00172.x 267 Acute pain in feline patients Cerebellar dysfunction following general anesthesia is reported to be linked to the use of ketamine in Persian cross cats99 but anecdotally happens in other breeds and mixed breeds. The cause is unknown, but can range from mild to severe and is usually permanent. NSAIDs The use of this group of analgesics in cats has recently been reviewed.100 They can provide up to 24 hours of analgesia, and are not subject to the legal regulations of opioids. Although several are licensed for use in cats in other countries, only one (injectable meloxicam) is in this class are currently labeled for feline use in the United States. These drugs act to inhibit cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes and because there is considerable species var- iation in COX expression, the ef\ufb01cacy and safety of a drug in one species cannot be assumed in another. It was believed that COX-1 was responsible for normal homeostatic functions such as maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity, platelet function, and renal autoreg- ulation, while COX-2 was associated with in\ufb02amma- tion. The development of COX-2 selective NSAIDs was hailed as a breakthrough in preventing toxicity from these drugs, but continued reports of problems associ- ated with their use suggest that the simple COX-1/ COX-2 concept is \ufb02awed and much more complex than previously believed. It is now known that in some spe- cies constitutive COX-2 is produced in the kidney and central nervous system and", "39": "is required for normal function. As a group, NSAIDs have a lower safety margin than opioids or a2-agonists and are not reversible. There is potential for NSAID toxicity in cats since their limited ability to glucuronidate exogenous drugs results in prolonged duration of effect with the potential for drug accumulation. The mean half-life of carprofen in cats is approximately 20 hours, twice that of the dog, but can vary from as short as 9 hours up to 49 hours.25,26 The use of carprofen, meloxicam and ketoprofen is well documented in cats.12,44,55,101,102 As in other species, the contraindications to NSAID use are gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding, platelet dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and concurrent cortico- steroid use. Renal autoregulation is prostaglandin de- pendant in the face of hypotension and NSAIDs must not be given in the face of volume depletion (vomiting, diarrhea, hemorrhage, or other \ufb02uid losses) or in situ- ations such as sepsis where low blood pressure is likely or has been con\ufb01rmed. Cats appear to be particularly susceptible to the adverse renal effects of NSAIDs. In some situations, for example, the stable norm- ovolemic trauma patient, these drugs can be valuable for alleviating acute pain. Carprofen has a long history in the United Kingdom where the injectable formula- tion (4 mg/kg) is licensed for a single treatment. How- ever, clinically there seems little bene\ufb01t of the 4 mg/kg dose over 2 mg/kg,12 and the lower dose is recom- mended. There have been reports of gastrointestinal toxicity generally associated with concurrent disease and prolonged administration of the oral formula- tion.103 Problems with repeated dosing are likely a re- sult of individual variation in pharmacokinetics. Meloxicam is a COX-2 selective NSAID that is avail- able as an injectable and oral formulation. In the USA, only the injectable formulation (0.3 mg/kg) is approved for", "40": "cats and for one dose only. Its use at lower doses (0.1\u20130.2 mg/kg) appears to be effective and may be preferred over the approved dose. The honey \ufb02avored oral liquid marketed for dogs is widely used (off label) in cats because it is palatable and has been used for longer periods. Ketoprofen is available as an injectable formulation but oral preparations are commonly compounded. The pharmacokinetics and clinical ef\ufb01cacy of ketoprofen are well documented.55,101,104 and it has been used for up to 5 days to treat cats with musculoskeletal pain105 Be- cause it is a potent COX-1 inhibitor, it may interfere with platelet function. There seems to be little difference in the ef\ufb01cacy of the NSAIDs described above for the treatment of acute surgical pain.101,102 Comparison of injectable NSAIDs given subcutaneously at extubation following ovario- hysterectomy (carprofen 4 mg/kg, ketoprofen 2 mg/kg, and meloxicam 0.2 mg/kg), resulted in 9 out of 10 cats in each group having desirable overall clinical assess- ment scores for 18 hours. Despite the cats\u2019 apparent comfort, none of the NSAIDs prevented postoperative wound tenderness.101 If used as part of an analgesic plan, the choice of agent will depend on personal pref- erence, and intended duration of use. Effects of analgesics on gastrointestinal function The effects of pain itself and the analgesics and seda- tives used in the critical care setting on bowel function must be considered. Pain can cause bowel stasis, ab- dominal distension, discomfort, and vomiting adding to the overall misery of the patient. Analgesic inter- vention often results in a dramatic improvement but if therapy is continued for days or weeks the effects on gastrointestinal function should be monitored. IM acepromazine (0.1 mg/kg) combined with bupre- norphine (0.01 mg/kg) or medetomidine (50 mg/kg) alone provided good restraint and did not alter oro- caecal", "41": "transit time in cats, whereas ketamine (5 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) did decrease gastrointesti- nal motility.106 The use of TDF patches has not sparked comments about constipation and transdermal bupre- & Veterinary Emergency and Critical Care Society 2005, doi: 10.1111/j.1476-4431.2005.00172.x 268 S.A. Robertson norphine patches did not affect food intake or frequen- cy of bowel movements.60 However, systemic treatment with buprenorphine can cause inappetence in some cats after 2\u20133 days, which often resolves when the dose is reduced (author\u2019s own observations), or if there are no contraindications, NSAID therapy can begin and opioid doses decreased or stopped. In humans, immobility contributes to constipation and this no doubt also applies to animals; although it may be dif\ufb01cult to encourage a cat to exercise, it should be given room to move around and the chance to in- teract with humans and toys while hospitalized. Opioid antagonists that work only at peripheral sites and do not antagonize centrally mediated analgesia show great promise in humans107 for treating ileus but have not been used widely in veterinary medicine. Special Situations Management of fractious patients Fractious cats are a challenge in the emergency setting because the clinician is unable to examine the patient and may have no history or access to previous blood work. It is often unclear if the cat is painful or not. However, physical restraint is often ineffective and can lead to further stress and even worsening of wounds or fractures if the cat continues to resist and becomes ex- plosive. Clinicians often resort to placing these cats in an anesthetic chamber and administering inhalant agent. Great care should be taken as endogenous cat- echolamines combined with a high concentration of in- halant agent can be a lethal combination. Iso\ufb02urane and sevo\ufb02urane do not sensitize the heart to catecholamines as much", "42": "as halothane and these newer agents may re- duce the incidence of complications. Alternative techniques include oral (transmucosal) drug administration. If the cat is injured and, therefore, painful, OTM buprenorphine (0.02\u20130.03 mg/kg) may be suf\ufb01cient to sedate the cat. Oral xylazine, detomidine, or medetomidine combined with ketamine can provide useful sedation108,109 as can ketamine alone.109 Head trauma In several situations such as high-rise syndrome or hit- by-car scenarios, cats have multiple injuries and require analgesic intervention and or anesthesia, but may also have head trauma. In these situations, opioids are the \ufb01rst drug of choice as respiratory depression (which would include hypercapnia and cerebral vasodilation) is unusual at clinical doses. Medetomidine causes un- predictable vomiting and increased intracranial pres- sure (ICP) and should be avoided. The use of ketamine in the face of head trauma is controversial but it appears that ketamine may in fact be neuroprotective.110 In a space-occupying model of brain edema in cats, ketamine (2 mg/kg IV) decreased ICP and improved cerebral perfusion pressure and in a cytotoxic model ketamine had no effect on ICP.111 In summary, there is now considerable feline-specific analgesic data available and this can be incorporated into clinical practice. Opioids should be the \ufb01rst choice of drug, with buprenorphine a top choice because of its ef\ufb01cacy and lack of side effects. Local anesthetic tech- niques are under-utilized and time spent learning spe- cific blocks will be time well spent. With care, the a2- agonists and NSAIDs can also be used. Ketamine may have a role to play in overall pain management but still requires further study in cats.

E-mail: ktobias@utk.edu Abstract Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of preopera- tive administration of oral carprofen, subcutaneous ketoprofen, and local nerve block with bupivacaine in preventing postoperative pain-associated behav- ior in cats after ovariohysterectomy. Animals Fifty-two female intact cats. Materials and methods Cats received butorphanol (0.44 mg kg)1 IM), carprofen (2.2 mg kg)1 PO), ketoprofen (2.2 mg kg)1 SQ), or bupivacaine in\ufb01l- tration block (1.1 mg kg)1 SQ) before surgery. Cortisol and drug concentrations and visual analog scale (VAS) and interactive visual analog scale (IVAS) pain-associated behavior scores were meas- ured 2 hours before and 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after ovariohysterectomy. Results Cats receiving butorphanol had signi\ufb01cantly increased IVAS scores 2 hours after surgery com- pared with baseline measurements. Cats receiving carprofen, ketoprofen, and bupivacaine had signi\ufb01- cant increases from baseline in VAS and IVAS scores 1 and 2 hours after surgery. VAS and IVAS scores for cats receiving bupivacaine were signi\ufb01cantly greater 1 and 2 hours after surgery than for cats that received butorphanol. Cats receiving carprofen had signi\ufb01cant increases in cortisol 1 hour after surgery and signi\ufb01cant decreases 24 hours after surgery compared with baseline measurements. Conclusions and clinical relevance Preoperative carprofen and ketoprofen have effects on pain- associated behavior similar to butorphanol in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Cats receiving bupivacaine blocks may require additional analge- sics immediately after surgery. Keywords analgesia, bupivacaine, butorphanol, car- profen, cats, ketoprofen. Introduction Most veterinarians", "54": "agree that ovariohysterectomy causes postoperative pain in cats (Lascelles et al. 1999). Practitioners are often reluctant to admin- ister perioperative analgesics, however, because of lack of familiarity with available drugs, concerns about side effects, or frustration with the need for record keeping of controlled substances (Lascelles et al. 1999; Wright 2002). The ideal analgesic would be inexpensive, easy to administer, readily available, long-lasting, and effective. It should have few side effects; and would require no special licensing or storage. Besides opioids and alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonists, options for controlling perioperative pain in cats include oral and injectable nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ketoprofen (Ketofen; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA, USA) and carprofen (Rimadyl; P\ufb01zer Animal Health, Exton, PA, USA), and local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine (Bupi- vacaine HCl; Abbott Labs, North Chicago, IL, USA) 390 Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia, 2006, 33, 390\u2013398 doi:10.1111/j.1467-2995.2005.00282.x (Hellyer & Gaynor 1998; Lamont 2002). The use of these drugs is attractive because they meet many of the above criteria. Administration of systemic or local analgesics before surgery may reduce an animal\u2019s need for postoperative pain intervention. Stimulation of per- ipheral nociceptors with surgical trauma can induce peripheral hypersensitivity and upregulation of cen- tral neuronal activity, resulting in a prolonged and intensi\ufb01ed pain response with further stimulation of the site (Lascelles et al. 1998; Lamont 2002). Once neural pathways are sensitized, the physiologic and behavioral responses to pain may persist, even when the nerves themselves are blocked or transected (Lascelles et al. 1998). Pre-emptive analgesic administration prevents this central sensitization, thus effectively limiting pain perception. Reports of the effectiveness of pre-emptive analgesia in cats are limited (Lascelles et al. 1997; Cambridge et al. 2000; Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 2002). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of preoperative administration of oral carprofen,", "55": "subcutaneous ketoprofen, and re- gional in\ufb01ltration block with bupivacaine in pre- venting pain in cats after ovariohysterectomy. We hypothesized that each of these drugs would reduce pain-associated behavior scores comparable to that of cats treated preoperatively with butorphanol. Materials and methods Fifty-two healthy (ASA1) female cats weighing >2.2 kg were included in the study, with 13 cats in each group. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and permission was obtained from the cats\u2019 caregivers before participation. Age of most cats was unknown, although all were suspected to be at least 6 months of age; two cats were at least 5 years old. Health status of the cats was evaluated by physical examination and measurement of preoperative packed cell volume (PCV) and total protein (TP) in all cats and additionally by evaluation of complete blood counts and biochemistry panels in the two older cats. Cats were randomly assigned to receive one of the following analgesics: carprofen (2.2 mg kg)1 PO) 2 hours before sedation; keto- profen (2.2 mg kg)1 SQ) after sedation; butorpha- nol tartrate [Torbugesic; Fort Dodge Animal Health (0.44 mg kg)1 IM)] after sedation; or 0.5% bupi- vacaine in\ufb01ltration block of the surgical site (1.1 mg kg)1 SQ) after anesthesia. Two milliliters of blood was obtained for meas- urement of baseline plasma cortisol and drug concentrations 2\u20133 hours before sedation and before administration of any drugs. Baseline (preoperative) visual analog scale (VAS) and interactive visual analog scale (IVAS) scores were recorded immediately before venipuncture. Forty-\ufb01ve minutes before surgery, cats were sedated with acepromazine [acepromazine maleate; Boeh- ringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc., St Joseph, MO, USA (0.022 mg kg)1 IM)] and ketamine hydrochlo- ride [Ketaset; Fort Dodge Animal Health (4.4 mg kg)1 IM)]. Anesthesia was induced with iso\ufb02urane in oxygen, delivered by mask, and", "56": "main- tained after tracheal intubation with iso\ufb02urane in oxygen. A jugular vein was catheterized with a 20\u201322 SWG, through the needle, 13 cm Te\ufb02on catheter to permit postoperative blood sampling. As described by Smith et al. (1996), lactated Ringers solution (16.5 mL kg)1 hour)1 for 2 hours) was administered via the jugular catheter, beginning after catheter placement, to provide volume replacement and cardiovascular support. For cats in the bupivicaine group, bupivicaine was admin- istered subcutaneously over a 2.5-cm distance along the midline midway between the umbilicus and pubis. All cats underwent routine midline ovariohysterectomy through a 2-cm incision by the same surgeon (KMT). Cats were placed in recovery cages in a feline ward for postoperative observation by a trained observer who was unaware of the preoperative treatment protocol. Visual analog scale and IVAS scores were recorded and then blood samples obtained at 0 (extubation), 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after surgery. Additionally, the observer made note of cats that subjectively had poor recoveries (i.e. violent, thrashing motions or biting handlers) the \ufb01rst 15 minutes after extubation. For VAS and IVAS scores, the observer marked the estimated degree of pain on a 100-mm line, with 0 being no pain, and 100 mm being the worst imaginable pain. Visual analog scale scores were based on observations of the cat\u2019s resting behavior. Cats that approached the cage door, arched their backs for attention, or stretched out in a relaxed position and actively groomed were considered to have VAS pain scores of 0; VAS scores of 100 would be given if cats were recumbent and open-mouth breathing or lost consciousness after anesthetic recovery. The IVAS score was recorded after opening the cage door, talking to the cat, petting Evaluation of four analgesic protocols in cats KM Tobias et al. \u0002 2006", "57": "Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 33, 390\u2013398 391 its head, and palpating its abdomen. Cats that did not object to or avoid abdominal palpation and had no \ufb02inching of skin or muscle with palpations were considered to have IVAS scores of 0. Agitated vocalization and biting during palpation or uncon- sciousness after anesthetic recovery were to be given IVAS scores of 100. The jugular catheter was then aspirated and 1 mL of blood was removed temporarily. An addi- tional 2 mL blood sample was aspirated and placed in a heparinized tube, and the initial 1 mL of blood was re-infused. The catheter was then \ufb02ushed with 1 mL of heparinized saline. The blood sample was centrifuged, the plasma extracted and stored at )20 \u0003C until blood samples from all cats were available for measurement of cortisol and plasma drug concentrations. Plasma cortisol concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay, and concen- trations of the drugs were measured with high performance liquid chromatography using modi\ufb01- cations of methods previously published (Furst et al. 1988; Willey et al. 1994; DeGraves et al. 1996; Tahraoui et al. 1996). Cats with VAS scores greater than 30 mm or IVAS scores of 50 mm or greater during postoper- ative monitoring received rescue analgesia (but- orphanol, 0.4 mg kg)1 IM) as needed. Data collected after rescue analgesic administration were not included in the statistical analysis. At the completion of the study, jugular catheters were removed and the cats were returned to their caregivers. The effects of treatment, time, and treatment by time interaction on cortisol level and VAS and IVAS pain scores in ovariohysterectomized cats were evaluated using a mixed model analysis of variance procedure (Proc Mixed, SAS version 9.0; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Cat was included in the model as a random factor. Time as a", "58": "repeated measure was evaluated and removed from the model based on the )2 log-likelihood statistic, which indicated that there was no improvement in \ufb01t of the model to the data. Values for cortisol were transformed using the log base 10 in order to approximate a normal distri- bution. VAS and IVAS analog scores were trans- formed using the rank procedure due to zeroes in the data (Proc Rank, SAS version 8.0; SAS Institute Inc.). Signi\ufb01cant differences in least square means among the various levels of treat- ment, time, and treatment by time were adjusted using the method of Bonferroni. Descriptive data are reported as the mean \u00b1 1 standard deviation, with signi\ufb01cance set at p \u00a3 0.05. Results Of the 52 cats included in the study, two cats (one from the butorphanol group and one from the car- profen group) were excluded after surgery because of anemia secondary to accidental overdose of IV \ufb02uids (up to 66 mL kg)1 total dose over a 2-hour period). A third cat was given ketoprofen instead of bupivacaine. Therefore, 14 cats received ketoprofen; the remaining groups each contained 12 cats. Mean surgery time was 12.1 \u00b1 3.9 minutes (median, 10 minutes) and mean anesthesia time was 30.0 \u00b1 19.2 minutes. Ten cats had poor recoveries, including six cats that received ketoprofen, three cats that received bupivacaine, and one cat that received carprofen. Rescue analgesia was adminis- tered 2 hours after surgery in one cat that received a bupivacaine infusion block and 1 hour after sur- gery in one cat that received ketoprofen. One cat from the ketoprofen group died 7 hours after sur- gery; results from this cat were not included in the VAS, IVAS, or cortisol data analyses. All cats had VAS and IVAS scores of 0 before surgery (baseline) and at extubation", "59": "(time 0). Cats which received butorphanol had no signi\ufb01cant changes in VAS scores compared with baseline but had signi\ufb01cant increases in IVAS scores 2 hours after surgery (Figs 1 & 2; p \u00bc 0.0231). Cats receiv- ing carprofen, ketoprofen, and bupivacaine had signi\ufb01cant increases from baseline in VAS and IVAS scores 1 and 2 hours after surgery (Figs 1 & 2; p \u00a3 0.0122). In all cats, VAS and IVAS scores were not signi\ufb01cantly different from baseline 4\u201324 hours after surgery. There were no signi\ufb01cant differences in VAS and IVAS scores at any time when comparing cats that received butorphanol, carprofen, or ketoprofen (Figs 1 & 2).

Cortisol concentrations at other time periods were not signi\ufb01cantly different among or between groups. Peak postoperative plasma concentrations of cats receiving butorphanol occurred at 0 hours for seven cats and 1 hour for two cats. Butorphanol was detectable in the plasma of all nine cats 8 hours after surgery (Fig. 4). Peak plasma concentrations of cats receiving bupivacaine occurred at 0 hours for four cats, 1 hour for three cats, and 4 hours for one cat. Two cats had no detectable drug at any time period. Seven of nine cats had detectable bupivacaine concentrations 8 hours after surgery (Fig. 5). Because plasma concentrations of butor- phanol and bupivacaine were extremely low at 8 hours, plasma samples taken 12 or more hours after surgery from these cats were not analyzed. Of the cats receiving carprofen, peak postoperative plasma concentrations occurred at 0 hours for one cat, 1 hour for three cats, 4 hours for one cat, 8 hours for two cats, and 24 hours for one cat. Carprofen was still measurable in the plasma in seven of seven cats 24 hours after surgery (Fig. 6). Peak postoperative plasma concentration occurred at 0 hours for all cats that received ketoprofen. No drug was detectable in 1/10 cats at 4 hours and in 3/9 cats at 8 hours (Fig. 7). Four of ten cats had detectable concentrations of ketoprofen in plasma 24 hours after surgery.

Post-mortem \ufb01ndings included pul- monary edema, unilateral chronic interstitial neph- ritis with estimated loss of 50% of renal tissue, and acute suppurative portal hepatitis and cholangitis consistent with ascending biliary infection or portal seeding. None of the post-mortem \ufb01ndings were consistent with acute drug toxicity. Discussion In this study, signi\ufb01cant increases from baseline in VAS and IVAS scores were seen within 1 or 2 hours after surgery. However, scores four or more hours after surgery were not signi\ufb01cantly different from baseline for any group. The average surgery time in this study (12 minutes) was relatively short com- pared with previous studies, in which surgery dur- ation ranged from 27 to 60 minutes (Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 1998, 2000; Smith et al. 1999; Ansah et al. 2002). Additionally, ovariohysterecto- my was performed by \ufb01nal year veterinary students in most previous studies (Lascelles et al. 1995; Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson", "63": "1998, 2000; Smith et al. 1999; Ansah et al. 2002). Cats in our study probably suffered less tissue trauma because of the short surgery time and experience of the surgeon, and postoperative recoveries would more likely be consistent with those seen in the average small animal practice. Because objective parameters such as heart rate, respiration rate, temperature, and cortisol concen- trations have not consistently been correlated with postoperative pain in cats, need for postoperative analgesia is often based on behavioral indicators (Smith et al. 1996, 1999; Cambridge et al. 2000). Behavioral changes associated with pain in cats, however, can be very subtle. Some cats may vocalize or thrash about, but more often cats that are in pain will rest quietly in the corner of the cage or hide from observers. Some cats will take a hunched or curled position, reacting only when the affected area is manipulated (Hellyer & Gaynor 1998; Wright 2002). Because cats may also with- draw in stressful or uncomfortable environments, pain-associated behavior changes in this species are harder to quantify with descriptive scales. Visual analog scale and IVAS scores have been shown to correlate with postoperative pain in cats, and most evaluators will include interaction with the animal and manipulation of the surgical site (IVAS) to increase the sensitivity of the scoring system (Las- celles et al. 1995; Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 1998; Cambridge et al. 2000). In our study, cats were to be assigned IVAS scores of 100 mm if they lost consciousness after anesthetic recovery. Be- cause of this de\ufb01nition, IVAS scores were 0 imme- diately after extubation because the cats showed no reaction to abdominal palpation, presumably as they were still under the effects of the anesthetic agents. Low dosages of ketamine and acepromazine were used in our study to provide sedation and immobil-", "64": "ization prior to surgery. In cats, acepromazine (0.05 mg kg)1 IV) administered simultaneously with a combination of oxymorphone and butor- phanol (0.05 mg kg)1 IV each) increased the mag- nitude of antinociceptive effects of the opioids 15 minutes after administration, but did not provide signi\ufb01cantly greater threshold responses 30 or more minutes after administration of the drugs (Briggs et al. 1998). Potentiation of antinociceptive pro- perties of NSAIDs and in\ufb01ltration blocks by ace- promazine in the cat have not been reported. The effectiveness of ketamine as an analgesic is cur- rently under debate. In humans undergoing limb amputation (Hayes et al. 2004) or tonsillectomy (Van Elstraete et al. 2004), ketamine given as an IV bolus at induction and continued as a low-dose constant rate infusion did not signi\ufb01cantly reduce acute central sensitization, incidence and severity of postoperative pain, or analgesic requirements after surgery. In another study, ketamine constant rate infusion increased mechanical pain threshold and reduced windup-like pain in humans that received morphine prior to experimentally induced burns (Schulte et al. 2004). Constant rate infusion of ketamine in dogs during and after surgery, when combined with fentanyl infusions, reduced post- operative pain behavior-associated scores in dogs undergoing forelimb amputation (Wagner et al. 2002). In cats, intravenous ketamine (2 mg kg)1) increased thermal threshold 15 and 30 minutes after administration (Robertson et al. 2003). Ther- mal threshold returned to baseline at 60 minutes but was signi\ufb01cantly decreased below baseline between 210 and 390 minutes after administration, suggesting that ketamine might cause a delayed- onset hyperalgesia. Because duration of analgesia provided by a single dose of ketamine has been reported to be relatively short and systemic avail- ability is less when it is given by the intra- Evaluation of four analgesic protocols in cats KM Tobias et al. \u0002 2006 Association of", "65": "Veterinary Anaesthetists, 33, 390\u2013398 395 muscular route than after intravenous administra- tion (Heavner & Bloedow 1979; Hanna et al. 1988; Sawyer et al. 1993), we are unsure that preopera- tive ketamine provided any signi\ufb01cant analgesic effects for the cats one or more hours after surgery in our study. As described by Smith et al. (1996), lactated Ringer\u2019s solution (33 mL kg)1) was administered during anesthesia and recovery to provide volume replacement and cardiovascular support. It is not known whether this dose of crystalloid \ufb02uid had any dilutional effect on plasma drug and cortisol con- centrations. In two cats, \ufb02uid rates were miscalcu- lated, resulting in signi\ufb01cant hemodilution. These cats were removed from the study. Cats that received butorphanol had no signi\ufb01- cant change in VAS scores, but did have increased IVAS scores 2 hours after surgery. It is possible that the combination of acepromazine/ ketamine HCl premedication with preoperative IM butorphanol provided sedation that masked visual behavior changes 2 hours after surgery, as pain- associated behavior was notable only after palpa- tion of the incision site. Butorphanol has agonist activity at the j receptors, which are responsible for analgesia and sedation, and at the r receptors, which are responsible for autonomic stimulation and dysphoria (Hosgood 1990). Sedative effects of butorphanol alone are variable, but are increased when combined with other drugs (Tranquilli et al. 1988; Hosgood 1990). Visual and interactive pain scores were signi\ufb01- cantly increased 1 and 2 hours after surgery compared with baseline in cats that received keto- profen, carprofen, and bupivacaine, although VAS and IVAS scores of cats that received ketoprofen and carprofen were not signi\ufb01cantly different from those of cats that received butorphanol. Bupivacaine injected perineurally can provide pain relief for 2\u2013 6 hours (Lemke & Dawson 2000; Lamont 2002). In this study, bupivacaine may have", "66": "provided less analgesia compared with butorphanol because of its lack of systemic effects. Additionally, bupivacaine\u2019s onset of action is 20\u201330 minutes (Lemke & Dawson 2000); thus, surgical stimulation of nociceptors may have occurred prior to onset of drug effects. Despite signi\ufb01cant increases in bupivacaine VAS and IVAS scores, rescue analgesics were only required in one cat in our study. Use of bupivacaine in\ufb01ltration at the incision site before surgery did not signi\ufb01cantly lower postoperative pain scores in dogs undergoing laparotomy, but did decrease the fre- quency of postoperative analgesic administration (Savvas et al. 2003). In cats that received carprofen, cortisol concen- trations were signi\ufb01cantly increased 1 hour after surgery. Cats in our study may have experienced an early increase in cortisol because of slow absorption or delayed onset of action of oral carprofen. Stress, anorexia, and pain may reduce gastric emptying time, intestinal motility, and portal blood \ufb02ow, reducing or slowing drug absorption (Jamali & Kunz-Dober 1999; Whittem et al. 2000). In our study, plasma concentrations peaked at a mean time of 5.9 hours after surgery (approximately 8.9 hours after oral administration). Although onset of action of carprofen after oral administration has not been reported in cats, delayed onset of action has been noted after subcutaneous adminis- tration in this species (Lascelles et al. 1995; Taylor et al. 1996). Cats that received carprofen in our study experienced a prolonged effect, as demonstra- ted by signi\ufb01cant reduction in 24 hour plasma cortisol concentrations compared with those measured before surgery. Elimination half-life of carprofen is 9 hours when administered orally and 19\u201320 hours when given IV or subcutaneously (Taylor et al. 1996; Parton et al. 2000). Because the pharmacokinetic\u2013pharmacodynamic relation- ship of NSAIDs is complex, peak plasma concentra- tion may not be a reliable guide for dosing strategies (Lascelles et al. 1998).", "67": "Additionally, long duration of action and huge variability in elimination rates in cats make multiple dosing of carprofen dif\ufb01cult (Parton et al. 2000). Pain scores from cats receiving ketoprofen were not signi\ufb01cantly different from those receiving carprofen or butorphanol, although cats in the ketoprofen group tended to have rough recoveries compared with other cats. In previous studies, ketoprofen provided analgesia similar to that of carprofen, meloxicam, tolfenamic acid, and bupre- norphine, and better than pethidine, when admin- istered after ovariohysterectomy in cats (Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 1998, 2000). Ketoprofen is not usually administered before surgery because of concerns about its effects on renal perfusion and platelet function. Ketoprofen inhibits both cyclo- oxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase and has a direct inhibitory effect on bradykinin (Isaacs 1996). Inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis through COX 1 inhibition may result in decreased renal blood \ufb02ow and glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (Isaacs 1996). Ketoprofen has good gastrointestinal and Evaluation of four analgesic protocols in cats KM Tobias et al. 396 \u0002 2006 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 33, 390\u2013398 renal safety in well-hydrated patients that have stable cardiovascular function (Maddison 2002). In our study we chose to use ketoprofen preopera- tively, as \ufb02uid supplementation would be initiated before, and continued after, the surgical procedure. Risk of toxicity may increase with pre-existing renal disease or hypotension secondary to anesthesia or blood loss (Isaacs 1996; Maddison 2002). One cat that received ketoprofen died 7 hours after surgery, and renal dysfunction may have played a role in its demise. Chronic renal disease in that cat was not evident on preoperative blood chemistry, although the cat had hyperglobulinemia consistent with neoplasia or chronic in\ufb02ammation (Dimski 1997). Loss of more than 75% of renal function is required before changes in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine are seen in cats with primary renal disease", "68": "(Dibartola 2000). Signs of NSAID toxicity such as gastrointestinal erosions or in\ufb02ammation and renal papillary necrosis (Isaacs 1996; Pages et al. 1996), were not noted on post- mortem examination. However, these changes may not have occurred rapidly enough to have been observed at the time of this cat\u2019s death. It is interesting to note that the cat\u2019s liver enzymes and renal blood parameters were normal after surgery, despite the pathology present in those organs. As ketoprofen is highly protein bound (Lees et al. 2003), hypoalbuminemia in this cat may have resulted in a relative overdose of the drug, poten- tially contributing to the cat\u2019s death. Because this was a clinical study with client- owned animals, we chose not to have positive and negative controls (animals undergoing surgery without additional analgesics, and animals receiv- ing analgesics without surgery). Additionally, if a nonsurgical group had been included, abdominal bandages would have been required on all cats to hide surgical incisions from the blinded observer. This could have affected the observer\u2019s ability to palpate the incision site and may have changed the cats\u2019 postoperative behaviors. In conclusion, preoperative oral carprofen and subcutaneous ketoprofen produced similar altera- tions in pain-associated behavior when compared with preoperative intramuscular butorphanol in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Because of variable and possibly prolonged gastrointestinal absorption of carprofen, administration of the drug more than 2 hours before surgery may be necessary. Cats receiving bupivacaine blocks may require additional analgesics for the \ufb01rst 4 hours after surgery. While preoperative ketoprofen caused no apparent adverse effects in young, healthy, well-hydrated cats, it should be used before surgery with caution because of potential adverse effects.

Pain scales have been developed that allow a semiquantitative evaluation of the degree of pain an animal may be experiencing. However, treating pain based upon observation of the painful state is less effective than anticipating and preemptively treating pain. This article reviews specific methods for preemptively treating and alleviating pain in the cat. The traditional approach to pain management involves drug administration. Specific categories of agents used in cats include opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, or alpha-2 agonists. Other modatities of pain management, which are also reviewed, include use of local anesthetic drugs for local and regional analgesia, as well as acupuncture. Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA).

As the awareness for pain management in- creases, so does the evidence-based research being conducted to validate treatment modalities. Nevertheless, a significant portion of veterinary analgesia remains experiential. This is especially true for the feline species. This article will present both the evidence-based information available and the clinical experience of professionals who have spent a tremendous amount of time practicing the art of pain alleviation. In a variety of studies, cats have received relatively less anal- gesic coverage than their canine counterparts.~,a The authors of these studies suggest several possible reasons for this disparity. There is a dearth of scientific evidence behind the practice of feline analgesia. This lack of scientific support for choosing particular analgesic drugs is further complicated by the chal- lenge of finding a safe drug for cats. Because cats have reduced ability to metabolize drugs via hepatic gtucuronidation, plasma drug concentrations are often prolonged. Cats are susceptible to toxicity from many drugs, including the popular .analgesic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

In the wild, a painful or injured animal will commonly be attacked by the other animals. 4 Therefore, a cat's expression of pain is often subtle to nonexistent. Unless specific attention is given to assessing a cat's analgesic state, pain is easily over- looked. Untreated pain generates physiological damage (Table 1). Subjecting animals recovering from disease or surgical inter- vention to these increased metabolic demands may further compromise their medical condition. Therefore, a modality to anticipate and treat pain is imperative to the most general prac- tice of veterinary medicine. Assessment of Pain Diagnosis of pain can be either presumptive or observational. Cats tend to hide when they are sick or in pain and it isunusual for a cat to vocalize when in pain. 5-7 A painful cat may be hunched, less responsive to external stimulus, and may guard the painful area. 5,6 Simple observation of an animal in a cage, however, relies upon overt expression of pain and is often inaccurate. In an attempt to improve pain diagnosis, work has been done to evaluate pain scales for use in domestic animals. 5-8 Pain scales allow a semiquantitative evaluation of the degree of", "75": "pain an individual may be experiencing, and usually take into account both physiologic signs--such as increased heart rate and respiratory rate--as well as the animal's response to stim- ulus and manipulation. 8 Although pain scales improve the sen- sitivity of pain diagnosis, nonverbal animals require an ob- server for pain rating, and stoically painful animals may still be missed. Postoperative pain can be very difficult to diagnose because of the blurring of physiologic signs of pain with other physio- logic changes. Studies show that heart rate and respiratory rate may not be different between operated-on and unoperated-on cats after anesthesia, r,a This is expected because many other physiologic changes can alter heart rate and respiratory rate, as can many pharmacologic manipulations, making these very nonspecific, inaccurate indices of pain. For instance, both stress from the hospital experience and pain tend to cause hyperventilation. Simultaneously, pain and splinting after tho- racic surgery may greatly reduce ventilation, as does broncho- constriction generated by the increased sympathetic tone of the stress response. Ultimately, the most accurate diagnostic indi- cator of pain may be responses to therapy, such as a more interactive patient or a patient that becomes able to sleep com- fortably. Although pain scales may be the most effective way for an observer to diagnose pain in a cat, by the time this assess- ment has been made, the animal is already in pain. 5-s Treating pain before initiation of the painful stimulus prevents central sensitization to pain, and is the cornerstone of modern pain medicine. 5-9 For these reasons, having a template for presump- tive diagnosis of pain before initiation is important. 2002: pp 151-157 151 TABLE 1.

This is an incomplete list of the results of pain upon the physiologic state. For presumptive diagnosis of a painful state, analogies with other species may be helpful. Nociceptive physiology is well preserved between species, justifying this extrapolation. 1~ If a procedure elicits a predictable amount of pain in people, dogs, or other species studied, it likely does the same in cats. Pre- sumptive diagnosis promotes analgesic administration before the painful stimulus, maximizing the preemptive facilitation of analgesia. Treating pain based upon observation of the painful state is therefore less effective than anticipating and preemp- tively treating pain. Anticipated levels of pain for illness and injury have been formulated (Table 2). These are presumptive only, and may be affected by severity, additional inflammation or infection, indi- vidual pain threshold, surgical technique, and concomitant sources of pain (e.g., osteoarthritis). Young animals tend to be less pain-tolerant and more demonstrative of pain, whereas geriatric animals will often hide their pain. s~ Treatment stan- dards established for the presumptive level of pain for a given procedure facilitate a multimodal approach to analgesia. If ap-", "77": "propriate analgesics for the anticipated level of pain are insuf- ficient for an individual, further analgesic therapy can be initi- ated. It is important to note that even relatively noninvasive procedures are likely to cause some degree of pain, and many preexisting diseases are extremely painful. These sources of pain need to be considered in addition to the analgesic tech- niques established for surgical patients.

Drugs that com- petitively bind to opioid receptors can do one of three things: completely activate the receptor (agonists), causing full expres- sion of receptor function; partially bind to the receptor, causing partial expression of the receptors function (or partially block- ing the receptor if it is already functional); or fully antagonize the receptor, completely eliminating the function of the recep- tor during the duration of action of the drug. Agonists and partial agonists are useful to produce varying degrees of anal- gesia. Opioids do not modulate nerve conduction, but inhibit release of excitatory neurotransmitters at the level of the brain and spinal cord. Consequently, opioids reduce the pain from a stimulus, but do not obliterate the stimulus or interfere with motor function. Common opioid side effects are bradycardia, sedation, urinary retention, respiratory depression, gastrointes- tinal (GI) stasis, vomiting and nausea (less common postoper- atively or in painful patients), and occasional", "80": "dysphoria or excitement. Opioids have minimal effects on cardiac function (aside from the effects of histamine release with morphine and meperidine), and are considered safe in compromised patients and animals with heart conditions. 1 There are three currently recognized opiold receptors,/,, 8, and \u2022. All three receptors mediate analgesia although the qual- ity of analgesia varies, as does the severity of side.effects. In general,/* and K receptors are the primary target in veterinary practice with the drugs currently available./x receptor agonists provide more profound analgesia in many species, although this is controversial in cats./, agonists are generally accompa- nied by more pronounced side effects than K agonists (Table 3). In studies examining the analgesic usage in veterinary med- icine, a reluctance of practitioners to use potent opioids in cats is apparent. Concern about drug side effects, as well as the need for record keeping for use of these controlled substances are cited as reasons for this disparity, z,2 Although an occasional cat may become dysphoric on opioids, it is uncommon at effica- cious doses, and not limited to cats. 3 Dysphoria can often be avoided by staying within the recommended dose range (cats have a lower dose range than dogs), and can also be greatly reduced by concurrent use of a tranquilizer. 3,5-9 When an indi- vidual exhibits dysphoria, adjunctive analgesic techniques such as c~-2 agonists can ameliorate the excitement while providing necessary analgesia. Respiratory depression from opioids is a significant problem in human medicine, but far less pro- nounced in domestic animals at clinical doses. 1~ Finally, the legal records required for opioid use are no longer restricted to opioids, and include many other commonly used anesthetic drugs. Emerging concepts in feline analgesia with opioids include the use of transmucosal buprenorphine, which has been shown to have remarkably predictable,", "81": "rapid, and effective uptake when sprayed onto the mucous membranes, facilitating home administration.12 Current clinical impression is that hydromor- CLINICAL PAIN MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES FOR CATS 153 TABLE 4.

Fentanyl patches have contributed to longer duration of analgesia, but must be monitored closely because of extreme variability in individual uptake and efficacy in cats. 13-15 Additional applications for opioids include local and re- gional techniques. Opioid receptors have been isolated on no- ciceptive nerve terminals in inflamed synovial tissue, although work has not been done to verify their presence in cats. 16 Intra- articular administration of opioids may be beneficial, especially when combined with a local anesthetic. A dose of 0.1 mg/kg morphine diluted to the appropriate volume for the joint being explored with saline or local anesthetics is recommended. 17 Additionally, epidural or intrathecal administration of opioids has been described as excellent anesthesia adjuncts. 18 The tech- nique for", "82": "epidurals has been well described in a number of texts.17-= With the addition of local anesthetics there is further potentiation of analgesia with a loss or reduction of motor function. Low-dose local anesthetics preferentially block sen- sory fibers in the spinal cord and may have minimal effect on motor function. 1<19 c~-2 agonists administered added to epi- dural morphine dramatically augment analgesia via synergistic action of c~-2 and opioid receptors in the spine. For long-term pain relief, placement of an epidural catheter can facilitate re- peat injections or constant epidural infusion of analgesic drugs. 18,19,22 Summary 9 Opioids are efficacious analgesics in cats 9 Opioids rarely cause excitement at clinical doses in cats 9 Systemic and regional use of opioids are possible 9 OpioMs and opioid combinations are ideal for epidural ad- ministration NSAIDs NSAIDs provide analgesia peripherally by reducing inflamma- tion, decreasing release of substances involved in pain recogni- tion and, in some cases (carprofen), centrally by reducing pain perception and reducing central hypersensitivity. 23 NSAIDs provide a cornerstone of pain management in people and act synergistically with opioids. However, dogs and cats are far more susceptible to toxicity from these drugs, so they must be used with cautionY NSAIDs function through inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase (COX), reducing the production of prosta- glandins. Two forms of COX have been isolated, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is associated with normal metabolic function (constitutive), balancing blood flow to organs such as the GI tract, kidney, and liver. COX-2 appears to be produced in re- sponse to tissue injury (inducible). For safety and analgesic efficacy, drugs that preferentially block the COX-2 receptor are preferred. These drugs include meloxicam, carprofen and etodolac (Table 4). Because of a cat's susceptibility to NSAID toxicity and aggra- vated by the lack of glucuronide metabolism in this species, NSMD", "83": "use must be practiced with caution. Despite some re- ports of side effects, carprofen has been safely administered to cats after surgery, and appears equally efficacious with other NSAIDs. 25,26 Absolute contraindications to the use of NSMDs include renal or hepatic insufficiency, dehydration, hypoten- sion, heart failure, coagulopathies, concurrent use of other NSAIDs or corticosteroids, or signs of GI ulceration. Geriatric animals should be fully evaluated before and during ~use. NSAIDs can contribute to bleeding and, although this risk is greatly reduced with COX-2 drugs, many surgeons prefer to administer these drugs postoperatively. Preemptive analgesia is recommended, so opioid administration preoperatively and im- mediately postoperatively to provide analgesia during the NSAID onset is recommended. 24 Summary 9 Cats are highly susceptible to toxicity from use of NSAIDS 9 Unlike opioids there are absolute contraindications to the use of NSAIDS 9 Used with caution NSAIDS are extremely effective analgesics 9 NSAIDs are safest given postoperatively, so adjunct use with opioids for preemptive analgesia is recommended or Agonists ~x-2 receptors are located peripherally in both presynaptic and postsynaptic sympathetic terminals as well as centrally in the brain and spinal cord near opioid receptors. Activation of cen- tral c~-2 receptors decreases excitatory activity, which provides profound sedation and analgesia. Undesirable central effects include decreased heart rate and contractility: Activation of peripheral receptors causes the undesirable effects of vasocon- striction, bradycardia, arrhythmias, and decreased stroke vol- ume. er agonists have synergistic effects with opioids and other anesthetic drugs, and do not lead to dysphoria or excite- ment. Xylazine (.05-0.1 mg/kg intravenously [IV] and .1-.2 mg/kg intramuscularly [IM] or subcutaneously [SQ]) and me- detomidine (:001-.01 mg/kg IV and 0.005~0.2 mg/kg IM or SQ) are the most common drugs of this class used in cats.

Individu- als in which opioid therapy is not possible because of tolerance or dysphoria and animals experiencing a rough recovery can be greatly improved with surprisingly small doses of c~-2 ago- nists. 2z Atipamezole and yohimbine are available for reversal, but also must be used with caution in compromised patients as the reversal drugs also exert cardiovascular changes such as increased peripheral resistance and arrhythmias. Analgesia will be reversed as well as the undesirable effects of these drugs, so adequate analgesia should be established by some other method before reversal. Adjuncts to Analgesia Therapy Other sedatives and tranquilizers can augment analgesia via reduction of anxiety. Although having no analgesic efficacy alone, benzodiazepines and phenothiazines can affect the anx- iety-dependent component of pain and reduce opioid-induced excitement. Care should be taken, however, not to use tranquil- izers in place of appropriate analgesic therapy in painful ani- mals. Ketamine has been shown to be an effective drug for inhib- iting the facilitation of pain that occurs after a painful stimulus (wind-up). For extremely painful conditions, a constant rate infusion of ketamine in", "85": "addition to opioids can dramatically improve analgesia, especially when initiated before the painful stimulus. 28,29 A loading dose of 0.5 mg/kg followed by an infu- sion of .01 mg/kg/min during surgery augments analgesia and reduces requirements for inhalant anesthetics. 28,29 The infu- sion rate is decreased to .002 mg/kg/min during recovery for 24 to 48 hours. This therapy is best combined with opioids, either via constant rate infusion of the opioid or with intermittent boluses. At these doses, behavioral changes are not usually observed, and people undergoing this therapy do not report changes in consciousness or hallucinations. Tricyclic antidepressants can be used at low doses to treat chronic pain conditions, although this is not validated in ani- mals, and may be primarily a result of the antidepressive effects of these drugs. 19 Amitriptyline 0.5-1.0 mg/kg by mouth (PO) daily may given with primary analgesics, such as opioids or NSAIDs, or with imipramine 0.5-1 mg/kg PO twice per day to improve analgesia. 27 Acupuncture has been successfully employed to treat acute and chronic pain conditions with minimal systemic side ef- fects. 3~ There is growing popularity for nonpharmacologic treatments of pain such as acupuncture, and many clients are searching for such options. Local Anesthetic Drugs and Techniques Local anesthetic drugs work by blocking nerve transmission via sodium channel blockade. These drugs, therefore, do not just decrease pain transmission as do all previously mentioned drugsl but completely obliterate the pain stimulus before it reaches the spinal column. This can be an extremely helpful facet of multimodal analgesic therapy because pain sensitiza- tion can be blocked before it ever begins. Traditionally, veteri- narians have considered local techniques as a substitute for general anesthesia, and the concept of using local techniques in addition to general anesthesia for surgical procedures is a reemerging concept that", "86": "provides low-cost multimodal anal- gesia. As with many other drugs, local anesthetic drugs seem to adial nerve R ;h Fig 1. Local block for feline declaw using lidocaine, mepiva- caine, or bupivacaine.

Care- ful attention to local anesthetic doses in cats is important to avoid toxicity because of their small size and reduced metabolic capability. Within appropriate dose ranges, local anesthetics are quite safe (Table 5). 19,2~ Seizures can occur at excessive doses, and eventually cardiotoxicity may occur, especially with bupivacaine, which occasionally shows cardiotoxicity before seizures. Local damage to nerves can occur with local anesthet- ics, but is uncommon with isolated administration. Addition of epinephrine to local anesthetics will extend the duration of action, but it also increases the likelihood of local tissue dam- age. Epinephrine should only be added to locals in areas with adequate collateral circulation; it is contraindicated if the area being blocked is a distal extremity because it may cause necro- sis from hypoperfusion. Common sites for local anesthetic administration in cats include: 9 Incisional blocks before skin closure: Dilute calculated dose of drug to the volume needed to block the area. The drug should be injected 1 to 2 cm beyond the suture line on all", "87": "sides so as not to interfere with healing 9 Declaw blocks for onychectomy (Fig 1) 9 Dental blocks for extractions/repairs 9 Epidurals for abdominal or hind limb procedures (Fig 2) 9 Brachial plexus block for forelimb procedure s distal to elbow 9 Intercostal or intrapleural blocks for thoracotomy Regional techniques are described in greater detail in several texts. 19-22 Use Caution when performing more than one block that the overall maximum dose of local anesthetics is not ex- ceeded. Dilute the maximum dose in saline or sterile water as needed to distribute between all sites. In conclusion, providing analgesia through a muhimodal approach including adequate preemptive coverage, postopera- tive supplementation, and local and regional techniques is medically beneficial. Although cats provide heightened chal- lenges to providing adequate analgesia, with a variety of drugs and techniques a pain-free patient can be achieved.

The procedure causes a postoperative pain process, so an effective protocol is needed to assess pain and control it. The study was conducted with 40 females, which were divided into three distinct groups that were given different analgesic protocols, consisting of dipyrone sodium isolated, dipyrone sodium associated with meloxicam and dipyrone sodium associated with tramadol hydrochloride. The objective of the research was to evaluate three analgesic protocols in order to verify the most effective and affordable one. It was observed that the three protocols are viable and effective, however, dipyrone associated with meloxicam showed greater pain control.

Introduction Felines are short-gestating multiparous animals, with great potential for producing numerous progeny that can reach sexual maturity after six months of age, according to the S\u00e3o Paulo State Department of Health. These factors associated with irresponsible pet guardians contribute to the uncontrolled population growth of dogs and cats. The World Health Organization states that isolated activities of collection and disposal of dogs and cats are not effective for population control. It is essential to act on the cause of the problem, that is, uncontrolled animal breeding and the lack of human responsibility for their care (WHO 1990). Surgical sterilization is the most indicated method for natality control,", "93": "since they are minimally invasive techniques, preferably from eight weeks of age, reports Vieira (2008). The technique prevents breeding, avoids the transmission of Research, Society and Development, v. 10, n. 10, e564101019148, 2021 (CC BY 4.0) | ISSN 2525-3409 | DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.33448/rsd-v10i10.19148 3 venereal diseases, zoonoses and other diseases, such as uterine infection and mammary tumor in females and prostate tumor in males. It also reduces aggressiveness and the habit of urinating around the house (Andrade et al. 2012). However, for Paula and Molento (2012), every sterilization procedure represents a potential impact on the animal's well-being, especially during the immediate post-intervention period. In conventional ovariohysterectomy (OHE), somatic and visceral pain occurs, and may be mild to moderate, according to Gaynor (2009). In 1986, the International Association for the Study of Pain classified pain as an unpleasant sensory and/or emotional experience that is associated with actual or potential injuries. Every animal is capable of feeling pain, any stimulus that causes pain in humans will also cause pain in animals, because they are endowed with anatomical and physiological components responsible for feeling pain. It is up to the veterinarian to identify and reduce this discomfort in the animal (Fantoni & Mastrocinque 2015; Silva 2018). 1.1 Pain physiology According to Martins and Fl\u00f4r (2015), the way each animal feels pain is subjective, because it is related to the pain threshold that that animal has, according to the painful stimulus to which it was exposed. In veterinary medicine it is complicated to know the threshold of pain, since the animal does not speak, so it is essential that the veterinarian knows the pathophysiology of pain, particularities of the species and if the procedure he will do will cause pain in the animal. To understand the events that are present in the pathophysiology of pain,", "94": "it is necessary to understand the processes of: transduction, peripheral sensitization, transmission, perception and modulation of pain (Fantoni & Mastrocinque 2012). Transduction is when a physical or chemical stimulus is transformed into an action potential, the action potential will leave the peripheral nerve fibers and will be transfered to the central nervous system (CNS), the transduction will give rise to the sensory-pain phenomenon. The stimulus will travel from the primary afferent fibers to the spinal cord and will be projected to the cortex, which is responsible for the conscious perception of pain (Fantoni & Mastrocinque 2012; Alves et al. 2017). Also according to Fantoni and Mastrocinque (2012), \"the inflammatory response that occurs following tissue injury is accompanied by the release of a \"soup of algogenic substances\", which, acting synergistically, alter the sensitivity of the nociceptors\". The transmission begins with the afferent nerve fibers, which carry the impulse to the grey substance of the dorsal horn in the spinal cord. The spinal nerves conduct the transmission in the trunk and limbs, in the viscera it occurs by the sympathetic, parasympathetic and splanchnic nerves, and finally in the head region, it occurs by the trigeminal nerve (Aleixo et al. 2016). Several sites of the brain are responsible for the integration, processing and perception of pain information, the reticular activating system (RAS), participates in autonomic, motor and endocrine responses to pain. In the primary sensory cortex occurs the discrimination and localization of stimulus intensity, it modulates cognitive and affective aspects of the painful sensation (Fantoni & Mastrocinque 2012). Felines seem to be less likely to present behaviors suggestive of pain when compared to dogs in identical circumstances. This fact may contribute to undertreatment of pain (Otero 2005; Teixeira 2005). The cat has both physiological and behavioral characteristics that are important in pain assessment.", "95": "However, physiological changes, e.g. heart and respiratory rate, pupillary size and neuroendocrine assays (cortisol, glucose, beta-endocrine etc.) are poorly correlated with acute pain in this species, in addition, anxiety, stress and fear affect these variables, especially in the hospital setting, according to Cambridge et al. (2000); H\u00f6glund et al. (2017). Therefore, pain assessment is mainly performed through subjective behavioral changes, which can often be subtle in felines, an example is the response to palpation (Monteiro & Steagall, 2018). Key behavioral indicators of abdominal pain in Research, Society and Development, v. 10, n. 10, e564101019148, 2021 (CC BY 4.0) | ISSN 2525-3409 | DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.33448/rsd-v10i10.19148 4 cats have been identified, which include abnormal postures (Waran et al. 2007). Another factor noted by Brondani et al. (2013) in painful cases is decreased appetite. It can be extremely difficult to assess the degree of pain experienced by animals and their ability to deal with pain (Mathews 2000). In addition to understanding the pathophysiology of pain, it is necessary to know how to identify and assess pain in animals, for Martins and Fl\u00f4r (2015), the methods responsible for this involve physiological, neuroendocrine and behavioral parameters. To assist the veterinarian, the scales for identification of pain in animals were created and the University of Melbourne Pain Scale (UMPS) is one of them, it is divided into six categories, based on physiological responses (heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, salivation and dilated pupil) and specific behavioral (response to palpation at the surgical site, activity, vocalization, posture, mental status), being assigned a score from zero to three, being zero for the animal that did not change its behavior or vital parameter, and a score of three for the animal that changed its behavior or vital parameter, indicating pain and/or discomfort (Pohl et al. 2011). The evaluation of", "96": "multiple factors increases its sensitivity and specificity. However, it may not be sensitive enough to detect small changes in behavior (Ferreira, Braccini & Franklin, 2014). UMPS also requires the observer to know the animal's normal mental state prior to surgery and anesthesia (Hansen 2003; Hellyer 2005). Other scales are UNESP Botucatu Multidimensional Scale, Glasgow Composite Scale, Visual Analog Scale, Numerical Rating Scale, and the University of Colorado Pain Scale. It is essential that friendly handling techniques are done and that the location is calm, clean and warm, as the environment can help ameliorate the aversive aspects of hospitalization and pain (Rodan et al. 2011). Individual response to analgesic administration, individual behavior, age and concomitant illness should be considered in the acute pain assessment process (Monteiro & Steagall 2018). Information about the cats personality is extremely relevant and can be taken into consideration during the assessment. 1.2 Applied pharmacology The most frequently used classes of drugs for pain control are those with analgesic potential, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids and others (Fantoni et al. 2002; Waran et al. 2010). NSAIDs are among the most used drugs in Veterinary Medicine (MacAllister, 1994); they act by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), which is involved in the inflammatory process and in central and peripheral pain sensitization (Landoni 2005; Bassanezi; Oliveira Filho 2006 apud Castro 2011), resulting in analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic action and can be used in both acute and chronic pain (Budsberd 2008; Teixeira 2010), but according to Pozzobon (2010), most produce side effects, such as gastrointestinal ulcers, kidney and liver damage, by inhibiting COX-1. Selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors were introduced to the market and meloxicam was one of the first (Pozzobon 2010). Meloxicam is considered an enolic acid-derived NSAID (Panara et al. 1999) and according to Curry et al. (2005), it also", "97": "has analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Sodium dipyrone is a water-soluble pyrazolone derivative used as an analgesic, antipyretic and antispasmodic (Levy et al. 1995). According to Abbate et al. (1990), there is a central and peripheral action. The peripheral component is exerted by the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), inhibiting the formation of prostacyclins, prostaglandins and thromboxane, which prevents the sensitization of nociceptors. Other studies have described dipyrone as being able to inhibit an isoenzyme of COX type 3, present mainly in the cerebral cortex, a central mechanism by which the drug would exert its analgesic and antipyretic action (Chandrasekharan et al. 2002). Research, Society and Development, v. 10, n. 10, e564101019148, 2021 (CC BY 4.0) | ISSN 2525-3409 | DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.33448/rsd-v10i10.19148 5 Tramadol hydrochloride is in the class of centrally acting analgesics, which inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, thus acting as an \u03b1-agonist. It also has moderate affinity for the \u03bc-opioid receptor (Lee et al. 1993; Raffa et al. 1993). Non-opioid mechanisms can potentiate analgesia without respiratory and cardiac depression (Vickers et al. 1992). According to Luna (2008), the advancement of science and animal welfare has increased the critical sense of the need for pain prevention and treatment in animals. Then, due to its importance, pain and its control are subjects that are being increasingly studied (Tranquilli et al. 2013). 2. Methodology The study was developed at the Veterinary School Hospital (HVE) of the Universidade Estadual do Norte do Paran\u00e1 (UENP) and at the Veterinary Clinic Auqmia, in the city of Bandeirantes, Paran\u00e1, between 2016 and 2020. The activities began after approval by the Ethics Committee on Animal Use (ECAU) of UENP (Protocol: 03/2018). There were 30 females of the feline specie selected from Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), so the clinical history was limited due to the lack of", "98": "information on each animal. In the preoperative consultation, 12 hours solid and a four hours water fast was recommended preoperatively, an anamnesis of the animals was performed, as well as a general physical examination, mucosal staining, and capillary refill time, in addition to checking heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature and degree of hydration. A pre-surgical hematological evaluation was also performed, which included: blood count, leukogram, and platelet count. The cats were tranquilized with acepromazine hydrochloride 0.05 milligram per kilogram (mg/kg), followed by morphine (0.2 mg/kg) and cephalothin (30 mg/kg). After 15 minutes, the abdomen was trichotomized. Anesthetic induction was obtained by the application of propofol (5 mg/kg) intravenously. The animals were sent to the operating room, where anesthesia was maintained with isofluorane in 100% oxygen, with assisted ventilation and a calibrated vaporizer. The animals received 0.9% sodium chloride intravenously (I.V.) until the moment of extubation. The animals were operated on by different surgeons, all proficient in the proposed technique. Three postoperative analgesic protocols were elaborated, being them Protocol 1 (PG1), composed of dipyrone (25 mg/kg SID) and containing 10 female cats, Protocol 2 (PG2), Protocol 2 (PG2), consisting of dipyrone (25 mg/kg SID) associated with tramadol (3 mg/kg TID) and containing 10 cats, and finally, Protocol 3 (PG3), consisting of dipyrone (25 mg/kg SID) associated with meloxicam (0.1 mg/kg SID) and containing 10 cats, described in Table 1.

In the evaluation by means of UMPS, in addition to the observation of the animal\u2019s behavior and palpation of the surgical incision, the values of heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and rectal temperature (RT) were measured, as well as the presence of salivation and pupil dilation, scored according to the categories evaluated in the scale previously described by Firth and Haldane (1999) cited by Oliveira (2016). The analgesic rescue is performed when the sum of the scores reaches 9 or more, and is done with ketoprofen 2 mg/kg, intramuscular (I.M.), with previous administration of omeprazole orally with a concentration of 10 mg.

Results and Discussion None of the means exceeded the score considered over moderate pain according to UMPS. However, in protocol PG1, four animals presented values over 9 at T24, as well as one animal at T48, requiring analgesic rescue. In relation to protocol G2, three animals presented high values at T24, so rescue was also performed. Finally, in protocol PG3, one animal presented a high score at T4 and two at T24, so rescue was performed. The protocols performed along with the scores for each animal are seen in the following tables. Table 3.

For statistical evaluation the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality was used, W being the statistical value, and the Anderson-Darling test for normality, A being the statistical value. Analysis of variance ANOVA and later Tukey's test were also performed; for one of the times, (T72), it was necessary to use the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test due to the fact that the treatment at this time did not meet the normality assumptions. The data were run in Rstudio software (Version 1.3.1056). For the normality test, it is understood that the p value needs to be greater than 0.05 (p > 0.05). At T4, the value of W was 0.98206, while in Tukey's Test, the p-value was 0.8773. In the case of A value, it was 0.25237, while the p value was 0.7137.

The treatment of post-surgical pain is extremely important for ethical and humanitarian reasons and to prevent the occurrence of deleterious effects on the body, such as on the metabolic, neuroendocrine and immune systems resulting from pain (Desborough 2000; Mui, 2008). The selection of ovariohysterectomy was based on the fact that it is common in the surgical routine and for favoring the population control of stray animals. It should be noted", "104": "that, although many studies recommend pain assessment in a control group (without analgesia), it did not occur in this study, justified by ethical and animal welfare reasons, since it is a surgery that promotes pain, according to Paulo (2014). Dipyrone is an analgesic widely used for pain control and as an antipyretic, but there are few published studies on its efficacy and safety in animals, especially felines. In the case of meloxicam, Mathews (2000), points out that NSAIDs have a longer period of action when compared to opioids, and it is possible to mention tramadol hydrochloride. This fact can be observed when comparing PG2 with PG3, because the latter has considerably lower values. Research, Society and Development, v. 10, n. 10, e564101019148, 2021 (CC BY 4.0) | ISSN 2525-3409 | DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.33448/rsd-v10i10.19148 10 Coleman (2007) states that several studies show that cats receive less analgesia than dogs under the same condition. Smith et al. (1996), adds that this is due to the fact that it is hardly evaluated in this species because in the presence of pain, cats remain silent. Other factors are the limited choice of analgesics and the fear of side effects. However, it is known that felines are the fastest growing pets in terms of population in Brazil (Brazil 2015), and there is also an increase in veterinary care for this species. Thus, it is extremely important to know about analgesia in order to provide well-being. 4. Conclusions Due to the inability of verbal communication and recognition, pain assessment becomes a challenge, therefore, it is essential to know the ethology, environmental, physiological and behavioral variations of the species studied, besides considering the animal as a unique being. In the current study, there was no statistically significant difference because the sample number (N) was low; therefore, it was", "105": "concluded that increasing the number of animals in the study will lead to relevant differences between treatments. Even so, the association between dipyrone sodium and meloxicam showed the lowest mean and median, indicating more effective analgesia. In view of this, studies with meloxicam alone will be necessary for a possible comparison with dipyrone. However, due to the absence of significant difference, dipyrone becomes a viable option, especially for its low cost. References Abbate, R., Gori, A.

C O R R E S P O N D E N C E Gabapentin as part of multi-modal analgesia in two cats suffering multiple injuries We would like to report our experience using gaba- pentin in two cats which had suffered major trauma resulting from a road traf\ufb01c accident (RTA). Pain scoring for both cats utilized a modi\ufb01ed 4avet scale (Coppens et al. 2001). Table 1 provides a summary of the pain scores, and of the dosage and frequency of administration of analgesic drugs for both cats. Cat 1 A 16-month-old male neutered Domestic Short Hair (DSH) was presented with diaphyseal fractures of the left distal tibia and \ufb01bula and a transverse", "110": "fracture of the right talus. During the \ufb01rst 2 days of hospitalization, intravenous (IV) buprenorphine (Vetergesic; Alstoe Ltd, UK) and per os (PO) melo- xicam (Metacam; Boehringer Ingelheim, UK) were administered for analgesia. The animal appeared comfortable, had a good appetite and was able to urinate spontaneously. The initial surgery stabilized the tibial fracture with a plate. Extradural (L7-S1) morphine (0.1 mg kg)1, Morphine 1% Preservative Free; Martindale, UK) with bupivacaine (1 mg kg)1, Marcaine 0.5%; AstraZeneca, UK) were injected preoperatively. Postoperative analgesia consisted of meloxicam and methadone (Physeptone; Martindale, UK) administered intramuscularly (IM) if the pain score \u2021 4/12. This resulted in the administration of methadone every 4 hours overnight. A second surgical procedure 36 hours later carried out pan- tarsal arthrodesis. In order to provide perioperative analgesia, a sciatic nerve block (bupivacaine, 1 mg kg)1) was performed. Meloxicam administra- tion was continued postoperatively and methadone administered every 4 hours. The following morning the cat was alert, relaxed and friendly. However, gentle touch of the cervical and thoracolumbar area consistently elicited an aggressive response. Gabapentin (10 mg kg)1 PO every 8 hours, Gabapentin; TEVA, UK) administra- tion was then commenced. Twenty-four hours later, the animal appeared more comfortable, and did not respond to touch or bandage changes. Methadone administration was then stopped and IM buprenor- phine administration commenced \u2013 initially every 6 hours for 24 hours, then only if necessary on the basis of pain score. No further buprenorphine was required 72 hours after the second surgery. The cat was discharged 5 days after the \ufb01nal surgery with the instruction to continue administration of gaba- pentin (10 mg kg)1 PO every 8 hours) for 2 weeks and meloxicam (0.1 mg kg)1 PO every 24 hours) for 5 days. Cat 2 A 15-month-old male neutered DSH was referred 4 days", "111": "after a RTA. Injuries consisted of a fracture of the left tarsus, instability of the right sti\ufb02e and split fracture of the symphysis of the mandible. Pre- anaesthetic blood screening demonstrated acute renal failure: azotaemia was 88.2 mmol L)1 (refer- ence interval 6\u201310); creatinine 1058 lmol L)1 (reference interval 40\u2013150); K+ 9 mmol L)1 (refer- ence interval 3.6\u20135.6); inorganic phosphate 5 mmol L)1 (reference interval 1\u20132.46); further, absent P and tall T waves were recorded on elec- trocardiographic investigation. Initially, medical treatment consisted of NaCl 0.9% with 2.5% dex- trose infusion, administration of Ca2+ gluconate, glucose boluses and insulin, and furosemide. During the \ufb01rst week of hospitalization azotaemia, creati- nine, electrolytes and urine output were measured routinely; \ufb02uid therapy was adjusted accordingly. Ultrasound examination detected neither bladder rupture, nor free abdominal \ufb02uid. A gastrostomy tube was endoscopically placed and used to 518 Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia, 2011, 38, 518\u2013520 doi:10.1111/j.1467-2995.2011.00638.x administer both \ufb02uid and food. During this period buprenorphine was administered IV every 6 hours for analgesia. The surgical procedure utilized an external \ufb01xator for pantarsal arthrodesis and an extracapsular technique to stabilize the sti\ufb02e. Perioperative anal- gesia was provided by administering morphine (30 lg kg)1) and bupivacaine (0.25 mg kg)1) intrathecally, at the L5-L6 intervertebral space. Postoperative pain was treated initially with meth- adone administered IM according to the pain score. The following day, the cat appeared comfortable; however gently touching the thoracolumbar spine evoked a pain response. Administration of gabapen- tin (10 mg kg)1 PO every 8 hours) was commenced and methadone was administered IM every 5 hours for the \ufb01rst 24 hours, then only if necessary, which it was not as 24 hours after the \ufb01rst gabapentin administration pain scores < 4, and the cat did not react to the palpation of thoracolumbar area. A week later", "112": "the animal was discharged with instruc- tions to continue administration of gabapentin (10 mg kg)1 PO every 8 hours) for 2 weeks. Gabapentin is a drug chemically related to c- aminobutyric acid (GABA) and binds Ca2+ a2-delta receptors mainly in dorsal horn of the spinal cord and forebrain (Siao et al. 2010); it is used as an anticonvulsant in veterinary and human medicine, and as an adjunctive analgesic in humans (Platt et al. 2006). In veterinary anaesthesia, gabapentin has been investigated clinically as analgesic only in dogs undergoing forelimb amputation (Wagner et al. 2010) and in an acute pain model in cats (Pypendop et al. 2010) using a thermal stimulus; in both cases a signi\ufb01cant analgesic effect could not be demonstrated. Pain management in cats with multiple injuries is challenging: opioids alone do not always produce adequate analgesia and in some situations may cause hyperalgesia. Non steroidal anti-in\ufb02amma- tory drugs (NSAIDs) may be contraindicated in subjects where shock, hypovolaemia, severe liver contusion or renal dysfunction are present. Continuous nociceptive inputs may cause tem- porary or permanent changes in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, leading to hyperalgesia and allodynia. In humans these conditions are success- fully treated with gabapentin, therefore we decided to administer gabapentin in the two cats here reported as opioids and NSAIDs were failing fully to control the pain. In our institution gabapentin (10 mg kg)1 PO every 8 hours) often is used postoperatively in dogs and cats after spinal surgery. At this dose gabapentin is characterized by low volume of distribution and slow clearance in the feline species (Siao et al. 2010).

Therefore, its effect should be care- fully monitored and its administration suspended should side effects \u2013 such as lethargy, depression and ataxia, occur. Nevertheless, gabapentin as adjuvant for the treatment of hyperalgesia and allodynia in cats should be considered in a clinical setting, although further investigation is needed to better characterize its\u2019 effects.

They then explain how and why NSAIDs can have such positive and, potentially, negative actions. They consider the best ways of enhancing owner and cat compliance, make suggestions about sensible dosing frequencies, timing of medication and accuracy of dosing, and emphasize the", "115": "importance of always using the \u2018lowest effective dose\u2019. They even cover the things that need to be considered when switching between NSAIDs. They discuss the common concurrent conditions that, while not necessarily precluding the use of NSAIDs, require careful consideration in terms of pros, cons and potential complications \u2013 including renal disease, gastrointestinal disease, cardiovascular disease and liver disease. They make a number of recommendations relating to the importance of pre-treatment screening, and the potential for interaction between NSAIDs and concomitant drug therapy (eg, glucocorticoids and anticoagulants). They ultimately help to classify those patients that may have a higher risk of developing side effects, and hence need very careful monitoring during therapy. They tabulate detailed dosing information for each of the NSAIDs that have so far been licensed in cats, as well as suggested monitoring protocols. Although data are still limited and NSAIDs have only recently become licensed for long- term use in cats in some countries, the panel conclude that this group of drugs has a major role to play in the management of chronic pain in this species. However, they underline that careful patient selection, dose titration and ongoing monitoring for the early signs of toxicity are essential.

This issue of JFMS contains the first ever international consensus guidelines on the long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in cats. This timely publication, which appears on pages", "116": "521\u2013538 (doi:10.1016/j.jfms.2010.05.004), is a collaborative enterprise by the International Society of Feline Medicine (ISFM) and American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP). It has been compiled by a panel of world leaders in the understanding of pain in cats and, without doubt, is essential reading for all small animal veterinary surgeons. It is interesting to reflect that although the first use of NSAIDs was probably by Hippocrates (some time between 460 BC and 377 BC), when he administered powder made from the bark and leaves of willow trees to help heal headaches, pains and fevers, it has taken until now for cats to gain the benefit of the long-term use of these drugs. Although NSAIDs have been available for dogs for many years, there has been a reluctance to consider their use in cats. While it is classically presumed that this relates to worries about potential drug toxicity, it is also likely that it stems from our inability to recognize pain in cats as easily as we do in dogs. This is perhaps not surprising, as cats tend to hide their pain. It\u2019s a strategy that makes perfect sense evolutionarily, as cats are solitary hunters and would have nothing to gain from showing pain \u2013 and plenty to lose (notably the risk of getting eaten by larger carnivores or primates). The guidelines have been produced to help us all to use NSAIDs effectively and safely in cats.

While most published data on their use in this species relate to short-term (often perioperative) therapy, there is increasing evidence of the value of these drugs in treating chronic pain in cats (for example, that associated with degenerative joint disease), and some NSAIDs have now become licensed for long-term use in cats in some geographies.

Guidelines These guidelines have been drawn together by an expert panel, which have reviewed the current literature on long-term NSAID use in cats and other species, and developed guidance on their use based on this information. The aim is to provide practical information for veterinarians to encourage appropriate NSAID therapy whenever cats will benefit from the use of these drugs. Introduction Pain in cats has many negative effects, both physiological and emotional.1,2 It is now accepted that there is no such thing as \u2018good pain\u2019 following surgery and during treatment for trauma or disease \u2013 eg, pain that inhibits potentially deleterious movement after sur- gery. Pain delays recovery, impacts negatively on a patient\u2019s wellbeing, and disturbs the bond with its owner and also the veterinary team.1,3 Studies have looked at the use of non- steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for acute, especially perioperative, pain in cats.4\u20137 Surveys have shown clinicians were more likely to treat pain in dogs than cats,8,9 as a result of dif- ficulties in recognizing pain, lack of knowledge concerning the use of analgesics, and fear of drug side effects in cats. Less has been published on the management of chronic pain in cats, but it is recognized that signs may be subtle and include withdrawing from attention, decreased mobility, reduced interactions with humans and other animals, poor appetite and aggression.10\u201312 JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE521 Chronic pain can be regarded as pain that has persisted for more than 2\u20133 weeks, often persists months or years, and may continue beyond the anticipated healing time. Importantly, chronic pain can become dissociat- ed from the inciting cause and be maladaptive, such that the degree of pain does not necessar- ily correlate with the pathology observed or perceived by", "119": "the individual, and is not associat- ed with healing.12 Multimodal analgesia is commonly advocated, but it is becoming evident that NSAIDs will play a key role in managing chronic feline pain, especially mus- culoskeletal pain, just as they do in humans and dogs.10,13\u201316 Until quite recently, while many NSAIDs have been available to treat dogs with degenerative joint disease (DJD),17 only a restricted range has been licensed for short- term (up to a few days) use in cats. At the time of writing, at least one NSAID \u2013 meloxicam \u2013 has been licensed for long-term use in cats in many regions of the world, transforming our ability to manage pain in this species, and a second \u2013 robenacoxib \u2013 has been licensed for up Collaborating to build a future of unparallelled cat care by: Raising the profile of the cat in the veterinary clinic Creating continuing education opportunities for veterinary care professionals Developing practice guidelines to facilitate high standards of feline health care Providing tools and resources to improve veterinary skills and knowledge STRATEGIC PARTNERS IN FELINE HEALTH AND WELFARE TOGETHER IMPROVING CATS\u2019 LIVES WORLDWIDE \u00a9 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of ISFM and AAFP. FIG 3 Watson, a DJD sufferer, enjoying the benefits of daily NSAID treatment clinical disease is present many owners may simply assume a cat is \u2018getting old\u2019, and even educated and attentive owners may not neces- sarily appreciate suffering associated with DJD without veterinary observation and insight. In the absence of medical intervention, many cats with DJD suffer pain and discomfort for years, greatly affecting their quality of life and the human/feline bond. It is vital that examina- tions of the older feline patient should specifi- cally address whether DJD is present, through history and physical examination and, where necessary, radiology and therapeutic", "120": "trials. Control of bodyweight, exercise and environ- mental modifications may help cats with DJD, as may other medical therapies. However, the dramatic responses reported to NSAIDs13,21,23 indicate that there is a huge scope for safe, effective long-term NSAID therapy in the large cohort of aged cats with DJD (Fig 3). to 6 days of therapy in cats (see Table 1, page 529).* There is little doubt that others will become licensed for long-term use in the future, due to the recognition of the need and value for such NSAID therapy in this species.10,11,13\u201315,18 Clinicians are aware of their duty to promote animal welfare and relieve suffering, but are also often reminded of Hippocrates\u2019 advice to \u2018first do no harm\u2019. This is often rightly used to question whether an intervention will actually do more harm than good, and to withhold that intervention when doubts exist. However, we need also to recognize that withholding treat- ments such as analgesics can sometimes cause the greater harm, because we are no longer addressing the pain and suffering the animal is enduring. In drawing up these guidelines, the international panel of experts\u2019 purpose has been to review the current literature on long- term NSAID use in cats, and to provide practi- cal guidance on their use. The overarching aim is to encourage more widespread and appro- priate NSAID therapy, when cats will benefit from the use of these drugs. However, most of our knowledge of therapeutic mechanisms or adverse drug reactions is extrapolated from work in other species, as there is a paucity of published data relating to cats. Common causes of chronic pain and inflammation in cats One of the difficulties in managing pain in cats is its initial recognition. It is important, therefore, to be aware of common causes of pain and to", "121": "have a high index of suspicion for signs and behaviors potentially related to pain. If something is painful to us, it is likely to be painful to a cat. Degenerative joint disease The most common cause of chronic feline pain is thought to be DJD, and this has been the sub- ject of a number of important studies in the past 10 years.11,15,16,18\u201324 From these studies, it is clear that DJD is very common, with radio graphic changes affecting up to 60\u201390% of cats (Figs 1 and 2),18,24 that it affects both the spine and the appendicular joints, and that it occurs especial- ly commonly in older patients.18,24 The hips, stifle, shoulder, elbow, tarsus and spine are the most common sites affected, although other joints can also be involved. Studies based on radiographic findings have limitations, though, as the changes observed do not necessarily cor- respond to clinical disease, or the severity of clinical disease and pain.

These include", "122": "various cancers (Fig 4a), particularly where definitive treatment is not possible, or in some cases for the anti - neoplastic effect NSAIDs may offer.25\u201328 Other common conditions associated with chronic pain where NSAIDs may form part of therapy include trauma, lymphoplasmacytic gingivo - stomatitis (Fig 5),29 idiopathic cystitis,30,31 skin disease and uveitis (Fig 6). In the last, both topical and/or systemic NSAID therapy may be valuable.32 Through their antipyretic effect, control of fever with NSAIDs may also be valuable in some situations. A short therapeu- tic trial of an NSAID without a definitive diag- nosis may sometimes be appropriate, using the response to treatment as a guide to diag- nosis and further therapy.

They exert these effects mostly through inhibiting the production of prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) by the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) and 5-lipoxy- genase (5-LOX) enzymes, respectively.33\u201335 Most NSAIDs primarily inhibit the activity of COX enzymes. Although some also inhibit LOX enzymes, for currently licensed feline drugs", "123": "this is generally short-lived in compari- son with COX inhibition, and evidence of additional clinical efficacy from this is lacking. More effective dual COX/LOX inhibitors may become available in the future.36\u201338 Two distinct COX isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) have been identified as being respon- sible for the production of prostaglandins (Fig 7).35 A third isoform has also been identi- fied, initially known as COX-3, now described as a splice-variant of COX-1, which seems to have a role in the central control of pain.38 Phospholipase A2 is the rate-limiting enzyme that initiates the COX pathway by liberating arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane-bound phospholipids. Both COX isoforms are then responsible for converting AA to PGG2 and PGH2 via identical enzymatic reactions. Following these initial steps, PGH2 functions as an intermediate substrate for the biosyn - thesis, by specific synthases and isomerases, of prostaglandins, prostacyclin and throm - boxanes. COX-1 converts AA to a range of mol ecules, including thromboxanes (TX), such as thromboxane A2 (TXA2), and prostaglandins, such as PGD2, PGE2 and PGF2, and prostacyclin (PGI2). COX-2 activity pro- duces a narrower spectrum of prostaglandins, specifically PGE2, and prostacyclin. The prostaglandins play a major role in many aspects of normal physiology, including vascular homeostasis, gastroprotection, renal development and blood flow, blood clotting, reproduction, bone metabolism, wound heal- ing, nerve development and growth, and immune responses. They are also involved in pathophysiological processes, including pain and inflammation, and cancer progression. However, much of our knowledge is extrapo- lated from other species, as there is a paucity of feline-specific data. Expression of COX enzymes Both COX-1 and COX-2 are enzymes that are constitutively expressed (normally present in tissues and at fairly constant concentrations), as well as induced (appear and/or increase in concentration in response to an inciting factor, often associated with inflammation). COX-1 is", "124": "considered as predominantly constitutive, being expressed in almost all tissues, and involved in the production of prostaglandins responsible for \u2018house-keeping\u2019 functions, such as the cytoprotective effects in the gastric mucosa, normal platelet function and mainte- nance of renal perfusion.39 Constitutive expression of COX-2 appears to be more FIG 7 Overview of the role of COX and LOX in prostanoid production Arachidonic acid 5-HPETE PGG2 PGG2 PGH2 PGD2 PGE2 PGI2 LTB4 LTC4 LTD4 LTE4 PGF2 PGE2 PGI2 TXA2 PGH2 LTA4 Phospholipase A2 Phospholipid cell membrane PGH2 synthases PGH2 synthases COX-1 COX-1 COX-2 COX-2 LOX LOX S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE525 restricted,39,40 although it is present, along with COX-1, in the central nervous system, kidney, vascular endothelium, reproductive tract and gastrointestinal (GI) tract \u2013 sites where COX-2 activity contributes to homeo- static functions.35,41 It appears that COX-2 has an important role in healing damaged mucosa in the GI tract, and although COX-2 has been shown to be constitutively expressed in the canine GI tract,42,43 informa- tion on cats is lacking. While COX-1 is the predominant constitu- tively produced enzyme, COX-2 is predom- inantly inducible and its production is dra- matically upregulated during inflammation, in which it plays a central role.44 The expres- sion of COX-2 may also be upregulated in certain neoplasms, and in cats variable expression has been reported in transitional cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, mammary carcinomas and pancreatic carci- nomas.25\u201328,45\u201347 However, just as COX-2 has some constitutive expression, COX-1 expression also has a role to play in the inflammatory response.39,40 COX and LOX selectivity, and NSAID adverse effects Inhibition of COX-1, the enzyme predomi- nantly associated with homeostatic func- tions, is reported to be the cause of most NSAID-induced side effects such as gastric ulcers and blood dyscrasias.", "125": "In an attempt to avoid this, NSAIDs with a greater propensi- ty to suppress COX-2 than COX-1, so-called \u2018COX-2 preferential\u2019 (or \u2018COX-1 sparing\u2019) NSAIDs, have been developed. Drugs that have negligible effect on COX-1 have been termed \u2018COX-2 selective\u2019 rather than \u2018prefer- ential\u2019, although there is no recognized pre- cise definition of these terms.48 However, it rapidly became evident from human studies that COX-2 preferential or selective NSAIDs, while reducing some of the side effects classically associated with COX-1 inhibition, still caused adverse events such as acute renal failure, thromboembolic disease and gastric ulceration,49,50 consistent with a physiological role for COX-2 in a number of tissues. For example, both COX-1 and COX-2 are expressed in mam- malian kidneys. They are found within dif- ferent cells of the kidney (macula densa, cor- tical ascending tubule, medullary interstitial cells), and play different roles, but both are important to preserve renal function during hypovolemia.50 Additionally, the inhibition of COX has been postulated to be associated with an increase in LOX activity, which can result in adverse effects on the GI mucosa. Furthermore, it has been suggested that dual inhibitors may be associated with fewer GI adverse effects than COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors. Although the COX/LOX selectivity of an NSAID may be important, this does not negate all potential side effects, and indeed evaluation of COX/LOX selectivity is not the only factor to consider when trying to predict the safety of an NSAID. There are several other issues to consider. Firstly, the risks of adverse events can be affected by tissue concentrations of the drug \u2013 where the extracellular fluid is of a lower pH than the intracellular fluid, \u2018ion trapping\u2019 of weakly acidic drugs, such as most NSAIDs, can occur with accumulation of the drug with- in cells (eg, the gastric mucosa).51 The", "126": "extent to which this occurs will vary between drugs but this local accumulation can affect the prevalence of side effects. Secondly, differences are recognized between species in both the expression and distribution of the COX enzymes.52\u201355 Very little feline-specific data are available, but there could be differences in susceptibility to adverse events as a result of such differences in cats. Thirdly, there are substantial variations in the reported COX selectivity of an NSAID based on the type of in vitro assay used to measure COX-1 and COX-2 activity. These results vary depending on the species used to source the material for the assay; and, even when the assay is performed in tissue from the target species, different assays yield different results.36,38,56 Additionally, differences in metab- olism of drugs between species can result in differing selectivity. In the dog, tepoxalin is a dual inhibitor for a short period of time only; but, in the cat, tepoxalin pharmacokinetics indi- cate it is potentially a balanced COX and LOX inhibitor throughout its kinetic profile.38 Other factors also affect the risk of adverse events \u2013 for example, age. Older humans are recognized to be at greatest risk of GI ulcera- tion; and in human medicine pre-existing renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease and hepatic disease are all relative contraindica- tions for use of NSAIDs. However, manage- ment of pain in the geriatric patient becomes critical to quality of life. Therefore, careful selection of NSAIDs and their dose, and the use of adjunctive therapies (such as proton pump inhibitors to assist gastroprotection, other analgesics to modulate other parts of the pain pathway and reduce the required NSAID dose, and fluid therapy to minimize effects of hypovolemia), must be considered rather than simply avoiding addressing pain in both humans57\u201360 and veterinary species.61 Patient selection, dose titration and ongoing", "127": "monitoring for the early signs of toxicity are essential.62,63 What does this mean for cats? Because of species differences in expression of COX enzymes and in the in vitro COX selec- tivity assays, it is imprudent to generalize results from any single study.64 With all these variables, it is not surprising that there is no simple answer to the question of whether a COX selective or a dual COX/LOX inhibitor is better, and indeed what the \u2018ideal\u2019 COX/LOX selectivity and profile of an NSAID is in the cat. It may indeed depend on the disease process and the individual being treated. Despite these caveats, and given the paucity of feline-specific data at present, we can only cautiously extrapolate knowledge based on data from other species. Practical NSAID therapy in cats Beyond the question of COX selectivity, many other factors are also important in choosing and using NSAIDs for long-term therapy in cats. Compliance Administering medication to cats can be challenging for owners, yet adequate therapy relies on good owner compliance. Along with NSAIDs, many cats will be receiving other medications and the \u2018administration burden\u2019 may be daunting for owners, leading to incon- sistent dosing. To help long-term use, a drug should ideally be highly palatable and taken voluntarily by the cat \u2013 for example, in food or as a treat \u2013 and veterinary pharmaceutical companies undertake much research into this.65 Published studies suggest meloxicam liquid is highly palatable in cats,13,16 with one study suggesting it was significantly more palatable than ketoprofen tablets.16 Other drugs may be compounded in specific flavors that are appealing to individual cats. 526 JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs However, it is important to follow all regula- tions and compliance policies for drug com- pounding,66 which", "128": "are different throughout the world, and to consider the potential effect of compounding on bioavailability and stability/ shelf-life. Additionally, owners must be consistent and remember to administer the drug. Based on the long duration of action of many NSAIDs in cats, this should be at a set time on treatment days. Creative reminder systems may help ensure cats receive medication on the correct day(s), at the correct time(s) and at the correct dose. Giving medication along with a daily food ration (which should also be done for safety) can provide a built-in reminder system for owners, and encourage owner involvement in the monitoring process. Dosing \u2013 intervals, frequency, timing and the \u2018lowest effective dose\u2019 Short-term pharmacokinetic data are available for a number of NSAIDs in cats, which form a basis for dosing intervals. While many NSAIDs are metabolized via glucuronidation in the liver, and the relative deficiency of glucuronyl transferase enzymes in cats may lead to a prolonged half-life for some of these drugs,37,56 others, such as piroxicam and meloxicam,56,67 are metabolized by oxidation. Single doses of many approved/licensed NSAIDs for acute pain in cats seem to have a duration of action of around 18\u201320 h.56 However, it is not known if such prolonged pharmacokinetics are necessary for appropri- ate efficacy. For example, meloxicam and robenacoxib have a serum half-life of approx- imately 24 and 2 h, respectively,68,69 yet both have been shown to be effective for daily treatment of musculoskeletal pain in cats by virtue of their European licenses. COX-2 selectivity Panel recommendations In keeping with other species, studies of NSAIDs in cats suggest no difference in anti-inflammatory or analgesic efficacy between COX non-selective drugs and variably COX-2 selective inhibitors. It is presumed, as in other species, that using drugs with a greater COX-2 selectivity in cats will help", "129": "avoid some of the potential adverse effects associated with COX-1 suppression, such as GI irritation/ulceration and platelet inhibition. However, selective COX-2 inhibition will not completely negate the possibility of adverse effects and may not confer any renoprotective effect in comparison with a non-selective inhibitor. It is presumed that dual inhibition of COX and LOX may be associated with reduced GI adverse effects over COX inhibition alone. However, it is unlikely that dual inhibition will completely negate the possibility of adverse effects. JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE527 S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs For most of the NSAIDs used in cats, it is not known if repeated long-term dosing alters the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the drug. In one study, the administration of flunixin daily for 7 days appeared to result in more rapid metabolism of the drug after 7 days and decreased pharmacodynamic effects,70 although the same did not appear to be evident during daily administration of meloxicam for 7 days.68 Additionally, informa- tion on the apparent efficacy of daily versus every-other-day or less frequent dosing is anecdotal, with no controlled studies yet pub- lished. Daily dosing of meloxicam at less than the labelled dose for a mean of 5.8 months was considered to be clinically effective and asso- ciated with minimal adverse effects in one non-blinded study,13 although efficacy was not measured objectively or with a validated assessment system. However, due to the inter- cat variability of pharmacokinetics with administration of a variety of NSAIDs, it is likely that daily dosing may be appropriate for some cats, while longer intervals might be appropriate for others. Unfortunately there is no practical way to determine which cats might be \u2018fast\u2019 metabo- lizers and which slower. Additionally, proba- bly as a result of their high protein-binding, which", "130": "may enable NSAIDs to persist in inflamed tissue sites for longer than in plasma, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity of these drugs often persists longer than would be predicted from their serum half-life. This may enable daily dosing even for drugs with a relatively short half-life.38,69 Indeed persistence at the site of inflammation has been demonstrated in an experimental study of robenacoxib in cats.67 It is, therefore, unlikely that a set mg/kg dose and dosing schedule will work equally well for all cats; furthermore, variations in the level of pain may alter the cat\u2019s needs over time. Very little attention has been given to the best time of day to administer NSAIDs to cats to achieve the most beneficial effect, a concept termed chronotherapy.71 Theoretically, long-term dosing may result in a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state. However, \u2018peaks and troughs\u2019 may still occur. If the peak beneficial effect on lameness occurs at say 5 h after dosing, treat- ment may be tailored to achieve maximum clinical effect when the cat is most active. The timing, therefore, may depend on a cat\u2019s lifestyle. Alternatively, an owner may find that at \u2018peak effect\u2019 the cat is more comfortable, it rests for longer and may choose to administer the drug to promote resting and sleeping at the most suitable time for the household. Dosing \u2013 accuracy Dosing accuracy will depend on the formula- tion of the drug. Liquids are more easily measured, and can be delivered in small volumes. Thus incremental increases or decreases in dose are potentially more readily achieved. However, differing dispensing methods can potentially result in wide varia- tions in doses. Tablets or caplets are not Dosing frequency Panel recommendations To avoid potential side effects, owners should be encouraged to work on titrating to the \u2018lowest effective dose\u2019 that works for", "131": "their cat, with the understanding that this may change over time. This dose may often be less than the labelled dose.13,14,21 In overweight or obese cats, it is prudent to calculate initial doses for NSAIDs according to their lean or ideal bodyweight. When attempting to reduce the overall dose of an NSAID, it would seem prudent to reduce the label dose but maintain the label frequency, where possible. The panel recognize that intermittent therapy, for example 2\u20133 times weekly rather than daily, is better than no therapy at all, and anecdotally appears efficacious in some cats. However, there may be a risk of significant periods of time when no effective therapy, or suboptimal therapy, is being achieved. Intermittent drug withdrawal, a reduced frequency of dosing, or a reduction of the dose may all help owners to assess drug efficacy. The panel see little rationale for pulse therapy with NSAIDs unless the underlying disease process varies sufficiently in severity that it does not require consistent analgesic/anti-inflammatory therapy. Treatment may be tailored to achieve maximum clinical effect when the cat is most active. Alternatively, an owner may choose to administer the drug to promote resting and sleeping at the most suitable time for the household. Monitoring efficacy There is no validated assessment tool for acute or chronic feline pain, although studies are ongoing.72 In studies evaluating the efficacy of NSAIDs in cats with musculoskeletal pain, improved mobility, and in particular the will- ingness to jump and the height of the jump, have been the most obvious signs of improve- ment,13,21 and another study found increases in mobility with administration of an NSAID.15 One key feature of chronic pain assessment is owner involvement and obser- vation, especially as pain may manifest in different ways in individual cats.56,73 It has been postulated that four", "132": "behavioral domains \u2013 mobility, activity, grooming and tempera- ment \u2013 are particularly useful to both clinicians and owners in assessing chronic musculoskeletal pain and monitoring the response to therapy.23 When treating animals with long-term dis- eases, an overall assessment of \u2018quality of life\u2019 may be beneficial; this includes, but is not lim- ited to, pain. An assessment tool may need to be individually designed since what is impor- tant to each patient will be different: can the cat climb trees, hunt, play with other pets in the household, and so on?15 This was the thinking behind the use of client-specific out- come measures in a recent study.15 Owners should keep a regular journal or diary of the cat\u2019s activities, as changes in mobility and behavior may be subtle and occur slowly. The owner is the best person to judge and track the cat\u2019s behavior and demeanor. It may only be obvious from consulting the \u2018diary\u2019 that a change in treatment is needed. 528 JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE always easy to divide and therefore delivering a small dose may be problematic and inaccu- rate. Intact tablets will provide a different dose to cats of different weights, which may not be a problem when the drug is licensed for a dose range, as for example robenacoxib, but may be a problem if a very precise target dose is required. Repeat subcutaneous injections may be another option in some cats and with some owners, although no NSAIDs are cur- rently licensed for long-term use by this route. Dosing \u2013 switching drugs There is little objective data available on the best way to transition therapy from one NSAID to another, and feline-specific infor- mation is lacking. There is concern about changing from aspirin to another NSAID in other species due to COX-2 dependent adap- tive", "133": "mechanisms that may occur during thera- py.38,61 However, there is uncertainty about the need for or timing of any \u2018washout\u2019 period with other NSAIDs.38,61 S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs Dosing accuracy Panel recommendations Liquid formulations will provide for the most accurate dosing and dose adjustment of NSAIDs in cats; and manufacturers are encouraged to explore this route of delivery. The use of a dedicated and clearly marked syringe for administration of the liquid (Fig 8) should be encouraged to prevent accidental administration of excess drug when it is administered directly from a storage container. Switching between NSAIDs Panel recommendations As a precaution, a \u2018washout\u2019 period of approximately 7\u201310 days should be used when switching from aspirin to another NSAID. A sensible precaution may be to allow a washout period of 3\u20135 days when switching between other NSAIDs, and potentially longer if the previous NSAID had a prolonged half-life. Additional adjuvant therapy with other analgesics should be considered if required during this time.

When renal hemo - dynamics are normal, prostaglandins appear to have a minimal role.

In humans, the risk of AKF is regarded as low, and can occur with both non-selective and COX-2 selective NSAIDs, although the risk may vary between individual agents.50,75\u201379 In general, the risks for NSAID-induced AKF in humans are higher with conditions causing renal hypoperfusion (eg, dehydration, hypovol - emia, congestive heart failure), with old age (occult renal disease) and pre-existing renal disease, with concomitant drug therapy (eg, diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs]) and with", "136": "higher doses of NSAIDs. The resultant AKF is usually reversible, provided it is detected in time.50,63,76,77,79\u201381 The use of NSAIDs also car- ries a small risk of inducing hyperkalemia in human patients, which is higher in those with existing renal disease and those on potassium supplements.50,57,75 In human medicine, the role of NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is much less clear. While some studies have suggested that NSAIDs may be a risk factor for developing CKD (so-called \u2018analgesic nephropathy\u2019),82\u201384 or in the progression of existing CKD,85 others have found no evidence of a causal associa- tion,86,87 and the difficulties in interpreting trial data have been highlighted.88 Where studies have suggested a link between CKD and NSAID use, the risk appears to be low, and may be exacerbated by heavy use of one or more NSAIDs.85,88,89 Two retrospective studies evaluated the safety of NSAIDs in a total of 76 older cats, including some cats with stable CKD. In both studies, cats received oral meloxicam (approx- imately 0.02 mg/kg/day) on a long-term basis for osteoarthritis. One study included three cats with International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) stage 3 CKD90 and an addition- al 10 cats without CKD that had serum creati- nine concentrations monitored,13 and the other included 22 cats with IRIS stage 1\u20133 CKD.14 Neither study showed any significant difference in the development or progression of renal dysfunction in treated cats, compared with age- and disease-matched controls, over an average period of 6 months13 or more than 1 year.14 Another study evaluated 73 cats that received oral piroxicam at an average dose of 0.2\u20130.3 mg/kg/day for between 1 and 38 months. In that study, no significant changes were seen in serum renal or hepatic param - eters within the first month of therapy in 43 cats that had follow-up samples", "137": "collected.91 During prolonged therapy, five cases of renal insufficiency were detected in 58 cats receiv- Renal disease Panel recommendations Based on data from cats and other species, the risk of AKF developing during appropriate therapeutic NSAID use in cats is low and not abrogated by the use of COX-selective agents. Monitoring serum renal analytes and urine parameters before and after commencement of NSAID therapy is highly recommended as a precaution, in an attempt to recognize AKF at an early stage should it occur (see section on monitoring). Risk factors for renal toxicity in humans are presumed to apply to cats. Where an increased risk of renal toxicity is anticipated the lowest effective dose should always be administered (which may be facilitated by the use of adjuvant analgesic therapy) and increased monitoring is prudent. NSAIDs should be administered with food, and therapy withheld if food is not eaten \u2013 see recommendations for GI disease. In cats predisposed to dehydration, such as with CKD, using a wet rather than dry diet is a sensible precaution to optimize water intake. Specific risk factors, such as dehydration and hypovolemia, should always be addressed before therapy is administered, and if analgesia is required in the interim period an alternative such as an opioid can be utilized. Care should be taken to ensure good renal perfusion is also maintained if anesthesia is required during therapy. Current data suggest that at least some NSAIDs can be used safely in cats with stable CKD at judicious doses, and that this should not be a reason for withholding analgesic therapy when it is indicated. Further data, particularly in cats with advanced renal disease, would be valuable and such pharmacovigilance studies are vital. The combination of cardiac disease and renal disease is problematic \u2013 care is urged with the use", "138": "of NSAIDs in this situation due to the increased risks of AKF. The exploration of analgesic options other than NSAIDs may be prudent, but the potential risks of exacerbating these diseases should not restrict the use of analgesic therapy where it is needed. As there is a risk of hyperkalemia developing during NSAID therapy in other species, especially in the face of renal failure or potassium supplementation, potassium monitoring is recommended during therapy. JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE531 S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs ing piroxicam, but as other therapies were being received, as the cats had underlying neoplasia, and as they were an older popula- tion without any controls, it was impossible to know if any of these were related directly to piroxicam therapy.91 It has been demonstrated that cats with CKD have higher circulating levels of gastrin92 and, as such, these cats may be at increased risk of GI adverse effects when NSAIDs are used. Gastrointestinal disease Because of the physiological role of COX in maintaining the normal gastric mucosal barri- er, upper GI bleeding has been the most common serious complication associated with NSAID use in humans. Indeed, the GI tract has been considered the major site for NSAID toxicity in both humans and animals, includ- ing cats.13,16,21,48,57,93 In one study of the long-term use of piroxicam in 73 cats with neoplasia,91 vomiting was the most common- ly reported adverse effect (occurring in 16% in the first month), although there was evidence that other therapies (eg, chemotherapeutic agents) contributed to the reported preva- lence. During long-term use of oral meloxi- cam at a dose of 0.1 mg/cat, vomiting was reported in 2/46 cats (4%).14 Direct topical injury to the GI mucosa may also occur and contribute to adverse GI effects.38,59 Although studies", "139": "in cats are lacking, in humans and other species, COX-1 has a major role in main- taining the mucosal integrity. However, COX- 2 expression is also thought to be important, especially for repair of injured mucosa.48,49,94,95 Factors that have been recognized as increasing the risks of GI adverse events in humans include higher doses of NSAIDs, the specific NSAID used, increased age, previous NSAID-associated GI disease, liver disease, pre-existing GI ulcers, and concurrent anti - coagulant or glucocorticoid use.57,59,63,77 Some of these risk factors have also been noted in dogs.38 In humans, the two main strategies to prevent GI adverse events with NSAIDs are to use COX-1 sparing drugs, and/or a combina- tion of an NSAID and a mucosal protectant such as a prostaglandin analogue (eg, miso- prostol) or a proton-pump inhibitor (eg, omeprazole).49,57,59,62,63,77 In cats, NSAID-asso- ciated gastric and intestinal ulceration and perforation is recognized and, in the current absence of species-specific studies, data from humans are considered relevant.56 Cardiovascular disease Inhibition of COX activity by NSAIDs can have a number of potential adverse cardiovas- cular effects in humans. These are uncommon or rare, but include occasional exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) and/or hyper- tension due to water and salt retention mediat- ed by COX-1 and COX-2 suppression in the kidneys; reduced platelet aggregation and bleeding as a result of inhibition of COX-1 mediated platelet thromboxane production; and thromboembolic disease due to inhibition of COX-2 mediated endothelial prostacyclin production.77,96\u201398 While ex vivo inhibition of platelet thromboxane has been demonstrated for a number of NSAIDs in cats, studies have not been able to demonstrate a clinically ben eficial effect in preventing thromboembolic disease, or in promoting unwanted bleed- ing.56,99 Currently, there are no data on the potential effects of NSAID therapy on blood pressure or CHF in cats, or", "140": "on whether COX-2 selective agents may have a prothrombotic effect in certain individuals, such as those with a propensity to develop thromboembolism. Gastrointestinal disease Panel recommendations It is assumed that, as in other species, COX-1 sparing NSAIDs may have a better safety profile than non-selective agents. As GI pain and discomfort may be difficult to detect clinically, the panel recommend the routine use of COX-1 sparing NSAIDs for long-term therapy in cats. NSAIDs should routinely be given with, or after, food in cats. Inappetence or anorexia may be an early sign of adverse GI events; hence withholding therapy in an inappetent patient is prudent. Furthermore, inappetent or anorexic cats are far more likely to become dehydrated, which would increase the risks of renal adverse events if therapy were to be continued. Cardiovascular disease Panel recommendations The risks of NSAID therapy in feline cardiovascular disease are unknown. The panel recommend that, based on human studies, hypertensive cats receiving NSAID therapy should have their blood pressure monitored regularly. Patients with congestive heart failure should also be monitored carefully, and the NSAID use should be titrated to the lowest effective dose. Given the relatively high prevalence of thromboembolic disease in cats, whether long-term use of highly selective COX-2 inhibitors might increase this risk, as has been recognized in humans, deserves further investigation. 532 JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs Liver disease In humans, NSAID-induced hepatotoxicity is an uncommon or rare event. It is regarded as an idiosyncratic reaction mediated by hyper- sensitivity or a metabolic aberration, possibly as a result of genetic polymorphism, although with salicylates it has a predictable dose- dependent occurrence.77,100,101 The risk of this may be higher in patients receiving other potentially hepatotoxic drugs and varies between different NSAIDs, with", "141": "toxicity usu- ally developing within the first 6\u201312 weeks of therapy.100\u2013102 Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity has also been reported in dogs receiving NSAIDs.103 Severe hepatotoxicity following clinical use of NSAIDs has not been reported in cats, although this may simply reflect the lower prevalence of NSAID prescribing in this species.56 Although NSAIDs are metabolized by the liver, pre-existing liver disease does not appear to predispose to NSAID-induced hepatotoxicity.38 As drug metabolizing path- ways are often well preserved in liver disease, withholding NSAID therapy in such patients may not necessarily be required without evidence of significant liver dysfunction,38 although reducing doses in severe/advanced liver disease is recommended in humans.104 In humans, pre-existing advanced liver disease may be a risk factor for NSAID-associated renal and GI adverse events.63,81 NSAIDs and concomitant drug therapy Glucocorticoids Concomitant use of glucocorticoids and NSAIDs carries a well-characterized increased risk for adverse GI events in humans and dogs,38,56 with an estimated 2- to 15-fold greater risk for peptic ulcer disease in humans.59,63 Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics The use of ACEIs (and/or angiotensin recep- tor antagonists) and/or diuretics along with an NSAID carries a well-recognized risk for development of acute NSAID-associated renal adverse events in humans,63,75,81,105 and there is evidence of a higher risk when all three drugs are used together.105 Both ACEIs and NSAIDs may individually result in altered renal hemodynamics and reduced GFR, thus together the risk may be compounded, and the use of diuretics may lead to volume depletion and a greater renal dependence on prostaglandins to maintain GFR.105 Anticoagulants Although COX-1 inhibiting NSAIDs may sup- press platelet thromboxane production and reduce platelet aggregation, clinically signifi- cant bleeding as a result of this is rare in humans and, to date, has not been reported in cats.56,61,63 However, NSAIDs may appreciably potentiate the effect of warfarin,", "142": "and other highly protein-bound drugs, through compet- itive protein binding63 and the use of these drugs together should be avoided. Liver disease Panel recommendations Due to the rare potential for NSAIDs to cause hepatotoxicity in other species, routine biochemical monitoring, including liver enzymes, of cats receiving long-term NSAID therapy is recommended. Dose-reduction (titration) should be considered in cats with pre-existing liver disease. In the presence of severe liver dysfunction (eg, as evidenced by moderate to severely elevated bile acids), and/or hypoalbuminemia (of any cause), NSAIDs should be used with extreme caution, if at all. Concurrent drug therapy Panel recommendations The panel recommend that concurrent use of NSAIDs and glucocorticoids should be avoided whenever possible. For short-acting glucocorticoids, a \u2018washout\u2019 period of around 5 days may be appropriate before starting an NSAID,61 but longer times should be given when long-acting steroids have been used. Because NSAIDs are highly protein-bound and have the potential to displace other protein-bound drugs, concurrent use of protein-bound drugs with a low margin of safety, such as warfarin, digoxin, anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital, and chemotherapeutic agents, should be pursued with great care, if at all. Based on data from other species, it is likely that the concomitant use of ACEIs and/or diuretics with NSAIDs will increase the risk of renal adverse effects. Appropriate care is needed if using such combinations, with increased monitoring and the use of the lowest effective NSAID dose. The use of analgesics such as opioids should be explored as alternatives to NSAIDs, or to help minimize the dose of NSAIDs required. JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE533 S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs Monitoring cats receiving long-term NSAID therapy Adverse drug events (ADEs) related to NSAID use most commonly affect the GI system, liver, kidneys and platelet function, but", "143": "lessons learned from the long-term use of these agents in dogs suggest that this class of drug is often used inappropriately and without screening and monitoring.106 While the need for, and benefit of, NSAID therapy in many situations is clear, screening and monitoring is important for the clinician, owner and patient, to help minimize the like - lihood of ADEs occurring. Until further data become available, especially from pharmaco - vigilance studies, suggested protocols for screening and monitoring cats on long-term NSAID therapy have to be based on a knowl- edge of the use of these drugs in both animals and humans, and it is important that protocols are adapted to the individual needs of the patient. Testing and screening before treatment Thorough patient evaluation before commenc- ing therapy is crucial, with a view to identify- ing concurrent conditions or therapies that may impact on NSAID administration, and allowing informed client consent to be obtained. Screening during treatment In dogs, most NSAID-related ADEs occur between 14 and 30 days (range 3\u201390) after the start of treatment.107 However, it is recognized that the time for an ADE to develop is extreme- ly variable, probably being dependent on the individual drug, the dose and the individual patient. In humans, hepatotoxicity is usually reported within the first 6 months of therapy, with more than 60% of cases reported in the first 3 months,102 whereas acute renal failure is usual- ly reported early, often within the first few days or weeks of commencing drug administration.78 Based on appropriate use of NSAIDs in other species, the prevalence of ADEs is low in healthy patients. However, the frequency of certain ADEs increases in some patient groups, and these can therefore be classified Screening before therapy Panel recommendations A thorough history and physical examination is mandatory in", "144": "all cats prior to commencement of NSAID therapy, paying particular attention to conditions and therapies that may impact on NSAID therapy. Wherever possible this should include blood pressure measurement (Fig 9). Ideally, the physical examination should be accompanied by laboratory testing. Laboratory evaluation should focus on the renal and hepatic systems, along with plasma proteins and hematocrit (see Table 2). The latter parameters may be surrogate markers of GI bleeding and/or mucosal damage. This aids in identifying potential problems and establishes a baseline for later comparison. Abnormalities identified in the clinical examination and on laboratory testing do not necessarily preclude the use of NSAIDs, but the risks and benefits of embarking on therapy must be discussed with the owner, and concurrent diseases may affect subsequent monitoring recommendations.

Classification of patients Panel recommendations Clinical recognition of patients that may have an increased risk of an ADE relating to NSAID therapy is important \u2013 not necessar- ily to avoid therapy, but to encourage more cautious dosing and increased relevant monitoring. Based primarily on experience in human medicine, the panel cautiously suggest that more vigilant monitoring may be required in the following situations: An increased risk of renal ADEs may be anticipated in cats with functional volume depletion (renal hypoperfusion, including that associated with hypotension during anesthesia); older cats (eg, >8\u201310 years of age); cats with concurrent cardiovascular, renal or hepatic disease; and cats receiving concurrent therapy with ACEIs, diuretics and \u03b2-blockers. As in humans, there may be a greater risk of NSAID-induced hyperkalemia in patients receiving potassium supplements. An increased risk of GI ADEs may be anticipated in cats that are older; have had a previous history of NSAID-induced GI signs; have renal disease; are receiving glucocorticoid or anticoagulant therapy; have a history of GI disease; or have concurrent liver or other serious disease. An increased risk of hepatic ADEs may be anticipated in cats that are older; have renal disease; or are receiving multiple drug therapies. An increased risk of cardiovascular ADEs may be anticipated in cats that are older; have hypertension; or have pre-existing renal or cardiac disease. Particular care should be taken with unstable disease such as congestive heart failure or thromboembolic disease. The panel recommend that, when NSAIDs are used in patients with perceived higher risks of developing ADEs, greater care is taken, efforts are made to use the lowest effective dose, and increased monitoring is undertaken (see Table 2). Monitoring during therapy", "146": "Panel recommendations Monitoring should take place routinely while cats are on NSAID therapy (Table 2), but the panel recognize that the extent of monitoring will be affected by many factors, including the presumed risk for the individual patient, financial constraints and owner compliance. Furthermore, multiple visits to the veterinary clinic can be stressful for some cats. Any recommendations have to be adjusted to individual situations. Involvement of owners in monitoring therapy is crucial. Owners need to be made aware of signs that should prompt cessation of therapy and/or the need for veterinary advice. Ideally a client leaflet, such as the one that accompanies these guidelines (Fig 10), or one supplied by the drug manufacturer, should be used to reinforce such information. To reduce the potential for ADEs, the panel suggest that NSAID therapy is always given with or after food. If the cat does not eat then therapy should be withheld. An initial reassessment of all cats is recommended after the first 5\u20137 days of therapy, and sooner if there is concern. Although rare, acute renal failure can be life threatening and can be seen within the first few days of therapy. In some cases a telephone conversation with the owner may suffice. A routine re-evaluation of all cats (Table 2) is recommended after the first 2\u20134 weeks of NSAID therapy. Thereafter, the frequency of re-evaluation should be based on perceived risks and patient characteristics. For \u2018lower risk\u2019 patients, the panel recommend that a re-evaluation (Table 2) should generally take place at least every 6 months. For \u2018higher risk\u2019 patients, the panel recommend that re-evaluation (Table 2) should generally take place every 2\u20136 months, depending on the perceived risks.

These drugs are commonly used in humans and animals to help relieve pain, fever and inflammation \u2013 most commonly associated with degenerative joint disease (arthritis). Controlling your cat\u2019s pain is crucial for its welfare. Many cats greatly benefit from these drugs, having better mobility, less pain, increased appetite and an improved quality of life. Degenerative joint disease (DJD) in cats Degenerative joint disease is common, especially in older cats. As with other conditions, cats may mask the signs of this disease. Problems and behavior changes in cats with DJD include: \u27a1Decreased activity \u2013 eg, sleeping more, not moving around as much, playing or hunting less \u27a1Decreased mobility \u2013 eg, reduced willingness to jump, not jumping as high, difficulty using the litter tray, stiffness, and sometimes obvious lameness \u27a1Decreased grooming \u2013 reduced time or difficulty grooming, a poor coat, overgrown claws \u27a1Altered personality \u2013 less keen to interact with people or pets, seeking solitude, \u02bbgrumpier\u02bc \u27a1Other signs \u2013 may include aggression or vocalization when touched and loss of appetite Understanding these changes helps alert you and your vet to the possible existence of pain and DJD, and will help you monitor whether therapy is helpful or not.

Your veterinarian may then recommend increased monitoring and careful adjustment of therapy to find the lowest effective dose of the drug for your cat. FIG 10 Client leaflet advising on safe use of NSAIDs. The leaflet may be downloaded from www.isfm.net/toolbox and www.catvets.com/professionals/guidelines/publications Safety first: If you are in any doubt, STOP the medication and TALK to your veterinarian ISFM AND AAFP STRATEGIC PARTNERS IN FELINE HEALTH AND WELFARE TOGETHER IMPROVING CATS\u2019 LIVES WORLDWIDE What adverse effects should I look out for? Licensed NSAIDs have been shown to be safe for use in cats. However, adverse effects can still occur. Most are mild, but some can be serious \u2013 as in other species they may involve the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, cardiovascular system or liver. Adverse effects may lead to a number of signs including: \u27a1Loss of appetite \u27a1Nausea or vomiting \u27a1Lethargy and dullness/depression \u27a1Altered thirst and/or urination \u27a1Diarrhea and/or black-colored feces \u27a1Yellowing of the skin, gums, or whites of the eyes What do I need to know? \u2714Make sure you understand how to administer the drug, how much to give, how frequently and for how long. If you are unsure, ask your veterinarian. \u2714Always give the medication with or after food. Your vet may suggest feeding canned rather than dry food to help encourage good fluid intake, as maintaining a good fluid intake is important. \u2714If your cat does not eat DO NOT give the medication. Contact your veterinarian. \u2714Talk to your veterinarian about what monitoring should be", "149": "done to safeguard your cat \u2013 how frequently your cat should be re-examined, what blood and urine tests should be done, and how frequently these should be done. \u2714Never give your cat any other medication at the same time without first asking your veterinarian. \u2714If at any stage you have concerns, or see any potential adverse effects, STOP giving the medication and contact your veterinarian immediately. www.isfm.net www.catvets.com Adverse events and adverse event reporting (pharmacovigilance) If ADEs are encountered or undesirable effects are seen, these should be managed as appro- priate. If adverse GI events are observed, NSAID therapy should be withheld, and appropriate supportive therapy introduced, until any mucosal lesions have healed. If therapy is re-instituted, it should be done so at the lowest effective dose with consideration given to the concomitant use of omeprazole (0.7\u20131.0 mg/kg PO q24h) or misoprostol (5.0 \u00b5g/kg PO q8h),99,108 and/or a different NSAID where licensing permits. Hepatotoxicity or acute renal failure are usu- ally reversible in other species on drug with- drawal and appropriate supportive therapy, providing they are detected early enough \u2013 this emphasizes the importance of patient monitor- ing and of ensuring clients are involved in this process. In humans, it is recommended that a three-fold increase in ALT should lead to cessa- tion of NSAID therapy. Milder increases may prompt more attentive monitoring, with further investigations being warranted if the ALT fails to return to baseline concentrations.57 Re-institution of alternative NSAID therapy after hepatotoxicity or acute renal failure should be done very cautiously. Increases in blood pressure have been documented in other species with NSAID therapy, and this should be monitored in cats \u2013 antihypertensive thera- py or more intense antihypertensive therapy should be used as appropriate. All ADEs should be reported to the relevant pharmaceutical company and regulatory board", "150": "to help the patient and enable accurate collation of information so that we can learn more about when and why they occur.

The panel believe that these drugs have a major role to play in the management of chronic pain in cats, but at present only limited feline-specific data are available. To date, published studies of the medium- to long-term use of the COX-1 sparing drug meloxicam in older cats and cats with chronic kidney disease provide encouraging data that these drugs can be used safely and should be used to relieve pain when needed. While further data are needed, and would undoubtedly lead to refinement of the guidelines presented here, the panel hope that these recommendations will encourage rational and safe long-term use of NSAIDs in cats, thereby improving patients\u2019 quality of life in the face of painful disease conditions. SUMMARY POINTS Addendum To date, several of the drugs mentioned in these consensus guidelines are not licensed for use in cats in the USA, including long-term use of meloxicam. Informed owner consent is an important guiding principle when making decisions on patient care and a signed waiver is recommended when using drugs in ways that are not specifically licensed.

In the absence of medical intervention, many cats with DJD suffer pain and discomfort for years, greatly affecting their quality of life and the human/feline bond. It is vital that examina- tions of the older feline patient should specifi- cally address whether DJD is present, through history and physical examination and, where necessary, radiology and therapeutic trials. Control of bodyweight, exercise and environ- mental modifications may help cats with DJD, as may other medical therapies. However, the dramatic responses reported to NSAIDs13,21,23 indicate that there is a huge scope for safe, effective long-term NSAID therapy in the large cohort of aged cats with DJD (Fig 3). to 6 days of therapy in cats (see Table 1, page 529). There is little doubt that others will become licensed for long-term use in the future, due to the recognition of the need and value for such NSAID therapy in this species.10,11,13\u201315,18 Clinicians are aware of their duty to promote animal welfare and relieve suffering, but are also often reminded of Hippocrates\u2019 advice to \u2018first do no harm\u2019. This is often rightly used to question whether an intervention will actually do more harm than good, and", "162": "to withhold that intervention when doubts exist. However, we need also to recognise that withholding treat- ments such as analgesics can sometimes cause the greater harm, because we are no longer addressing the pain and suffering the animal is enduring. In drawing up these guidelines, the international panel of experts\u2019 purpose has been to review the current literature on long- term NSAID use in cats, and to provide practi- cal guidance on their use. The overarching aim is to encourage more widespread and appro- priate NSAID therapy, when cats will benefit from the use of these drugs. However, most of our knowledge of therapeutic mechanisms or adverse drug reactions is extrapolated from work in other species, as there is a paucity of published data relating to cats. Common causes of chronic pain and inflammation in cats One of the difficulties in managing pain in cats is its initial recognition. It is important, therefore, to be aware of common causes of pain and to have a high index of suspicion for signs and behav- iours potentially related to pain. If something is painful to us, it is likely to be painful to a cat. Degenerative joint disease The most common cause of chronic feline pain is thought to be DJD, and this has been the sub- ject of a number of important studies in the past 10 years.11,15,16,18\u201324 From these studies, it is clear that DJD is very common, with radio graphic changes affecting up to 60\u201390% of cats (Figs 1 and 2),18,24 that it affects both the spine and the appendicular joints, and that it occurs especial- ly commonly in older patients.18,24 The hips, stifle, shoulder, elbow, tarsus and spine are the most common sites affected, although other joints can also be involved. Studies based on radiographic findings have limitations,", "163": "though, as the changes observed do not necessarily cor- respond to clinical disease, or the severity of clinical disease and pain. Nevertheless, where 522 JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs Pain delays recovery, impacts negatively on a patient\u2019s wellbeing, and disturbs the bond with its owner and also the veterinary team.

Other diseases There are many other feline diseases where control of protracted inflammation and pain is important. These include various cancers (Fig 4a), particularly where definitive treatment is not possible, or in some cases for the anti - neoplastic effect NSAIDs may offer.25\u201328 Other common conditions associated with chronic pain where NSAIDs may form part of therapy include trauma, lymphoplasmacytic gingivo - stomatitis (Fig 5),29 idiopathic cystitis,30,31 skin disease and uveitis (Fig 6). In the last, both topical and/or systemic NSAID therapy may be valuable.32 Through their antipyretic effect, control of fever with NSAIDs may also be valuable in some situations. A short therapeu- tic trial of an NSAID without a definitive diag- nosis may sometimes be appropriate, using the response to treatment as a guide to diag- nosis and further therapy. Informed client consent and close monitoring of the patient is mandatory, especially in such cases. a", "164": "FIG 4 Transitional carcinoma of the bladder (a) and multifocal osteomyelitic bone lesions (b) in two feline patients.

They exert these effects mostly through inhibiting the production of prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) by the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) and 5-lipoxy- genase (5-LOX) enzymes, respectively.33\u201335 Most NSAIDs primarily inhibit the activity of COX enzymes. Although some also inhibit LOX enzymes, for currently licensed feline drugs this is generally short-lived in compari- son with COX inhibition, and evidence of additional clinical efficacy from this is lacking. More effective dual COX/LOX inhibitors may become available in the future.36\u201338 Two distinct COX isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) have been identified as being respon- sible for the production of prostaglandins (Fig 7).35 A third isoform has also been identi- fied, initially known as COX-3, now described as a splice-variant of COX-1, which seems to have a role in the central control of pain.38 Phospholipase A2 is the rate-limiting enzyme that initiates the COX pathway by liberating arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane-bound phospholipids. Both COX isoforms are then responsible for converting AA to PGG2 and PGH2 via identical enzymatic reactions. Following these initial", "165": "steps, PGH2 functions as an intermediate substrate for the biosyn - thesis, by specific synthases and isomerases, of prostaglandins, prostacyclin and throm - boxanes. COX-1 converts AA to a range of mol ecules, including thromboxanes (TX), such as thromboxane A2 (TXA2), and prostaglandins, such as PGD2, PGE2 and PGF2, and prostacyclin (PGI2). COX-2 activity pro- duces a narrower spectrum of prostaglandins, specifically PGE2, and prostacyclin. The prostaglandins play a major role in many aspects of normal physiology, including vascular homeostasis, gastroprotection, renal development and blood flow, blood clotting, reproduction, bone metabolism, wound heal- ing, nerve development and growth, and immune responses. They are also involved in pathophysiological processes, including pain and inflammation, and cancer progression. However, much of our knowledge is extrapo- lated from other species, as there is a paucity of feline-specific data. Expression of COX enzymes Both COX-1 and COX-2 are enzymes that are constitutively expressed (normally present in tissues and at fairly constant concentrations), as well as induced (appear and/or increase in concentration in response to an inciting factor, often associated with inflammation). COX-1 is considered as predominantly constitutive, being expressed in almost all tissues, and involved in the production of prostaglandins responsible for \u2018house-keeping\u2019 functions, such as the cytoprotective effects in the gastric mucosa, normal platelet function and mainte- nance of renal perfusion.39 Constitutive expression of COX-2 appears to be more FIG 7 Overview of the role of COX and LOX in prostanoid production Arachidonic acid 5-HPETE PGG2 PGG2 PGH2 PGD2 PGE2 PGI2 LTB4 LTC4 LTD4 LTE4 PGF2 PGE2 PGI2 TXA2 PGH2 LTA4 Phospholipase A2 Phospholipid cell membrane PGH2 synthases PGH2 synthases COX-1 COX-1 COX-2 COX-2 LOX LOX at University of Bristol on June 24, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE525 restricted,39,40", "166": "although it is present, along with COX-1, in the central nervous system, kidney, vascular endothelium, reproductive tract and gastrointestinal (GI) tract \u2013 sites where COX-2 activity contributes to homeo- static functions.35,41 It appears that COX-2 has an important role in healing damaged mucosa in the GI tract, and although COX-2 has been shown to be constitutively expressed in the canine GI tract,42,43 informa- tion on cats is lacking. While COX-1 is the predominant constitu- tively produced enzyme, COX-2 is predom- inantly inducible and its production is dra- matically upregulated during inflammation, in which it plays a central role.44 The expres- sion of COX-2 may also be upregulated in certain neoplasms, and in cats variable expression has been reported in transitional cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, mammary carcinomas and pancreatic carci- nomas.25\u201328,45\u201347 However, just as COX-2 has some constitutive expression, COX-1 expression also has a role to play in the inflammatory response.39,40 COX and LOX selectivity, and NSAID adverse effects Inhibition of COX-1, the enzyme predomi- nantly associated with homeostatic func- tions, is reported to be the cause of most NSAID-induced side effects such as gastric ulcers and blood dyscrasias. In an attempt to avoid this, NSAIDs with a greater propensi- ty to suppress COX-2 than COX-1, so-called \u2018COX-2 preferential\u2019 (or \u2018COX-1 sparing\u2019) NSAIDs, have been developed. Drugs that have negligible effect on COX-1 have been termed \u2018COX-2 selective\u2019 rather than \u2018prefer- ential\u2019, although there is no recognised pre- cise definition of these terms.48 However, it rapidly became evident from human studies that COX-2 preferential or selective NSAIDs, while reducing some of the side effects classically associated with COX-1 inhibition, still caused adverse events such as acute renal failure, thromboembolic disease and gastric ulceration,49,50 consistent with a physiological role for COX-2 in a number of tissues. For example, both COX-1 and", "167": "COX-2 are expressed in mam- malian kidneys. They are found within dif- ferent cells of the kidney (macula densa, cor- tical ascending tubule, medullary interstitial cells), and play different roles, but both are important to preserve renal function during hypovolaemia.50 Additionally, the inhibition of COX has been postulated to be associated with an increase in LOX activity, which can result in adverse effects on the GI mucosa. Furthermore, it has been suggested that dual inhibitors may be associated with fewer GI adverse effects than COX-1 or COX-2 inhibitors. Although the COX/LOX selectivity of an NSAID may be important, this does not negate all potential side effects, and indeed evaluation of COX/LOX selectivity is not the only factor to consider when trying to predict the safety of an NSAID. There are several other issues to consider. Firstly, the risks of adverse events can be affected by tissue concentrations of the drug \u2013 where the extracellular fluid is of a lower pH than the intracellular fluid, \u2018ion trapping\u2019 of weakly acidic drugs, such as most NSAIDs, can occur with accumulation of the drug with- in cells (eg, the gastric mucosa).51 The extent to which this occurs will vary between drugs but this local accumulation can affect the prevalence of side effects. Secondly, differences are recognised between species in both the expression and distribution of the COX enzymes.52\u201355 Very little feline-specific data are available, but there could be differences in susceptibility to adverse events as a result of such differences in cats. Thirdly, there are substantial variations in the reported COX selectivity of an NSAID based on the type of in vitro assay used to measure COX-1 and COX-2 activity. These results vary depending on the species used to source the material for the assay; and, even when the assay is performed in", "168": "tissue from the target species, different assays yield different results.36,38,56 Additionally, differences in metab- olism of drugs between species can result in differing selectivity. In the dog, tepoxalin is a dual inhibitor for a short period of time only; but, in the cat, tepoxalin pharmacokinetics indi- cate it is potentially a balanced COX and LOX inhibitor throughout its kinetic profile.38 Other factors also affect the risk of adverse events \u2013 for example, age. Older humans are recognised to be at greatest risk of GI ulcera- tion; and in human medicine pre-existing renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease and hepatic disease are all relative contraindica- tions for use of NSAIDs. However, manage- ment of pain in the geriatric patient becomes critical to quality of life. Therefore, careful selection of NSAIDs and their dose, and the use of adjunctive therapies (such as proton pump inhibitors to assist gastroprotection, other analgesics to modulate other parts of the pain pathway and reduce the required NSAID dose, and fluid therapy to minimise effects of hypovolaemia), must be considered rather than simply avoiding addressing pain in both humans57\u201360 and veterinary species.61 Patient selection, dose titration and ongoing monitoring for the early signs of toxicity are essential.62,63 at University of Bristol on June 24, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from What does this mean for cats? Because of species differences in expression of COX enzymes and in the in vitro COX selec- tivity assays, it is imprudent to generalise results from any single study.64 With all these variables, it is not surprising that there is no simple answer to the question of whether a COX selective or a dual COX/LOX inhibitor is better, and indeed what the \u2018ideal\u2019 COX/LOX selectivity and profile of an NSAID is in the cat. It may indeed depend on the disease process and the individual being", "169": "treated. Despite these caveats, and given the paucity of feline-specific data at present, we can only cautiously extrapolate knowledge based on data from other species. Practical NSAID therapy in cats Beyond the question of COX selectivity, many other factors are also important in choosing and using NSAIDs for long-term therapy in cats. Compliance Administering medication to cats can be challenging for owners, yet adequate therapy relies on good owner compliance. Along with NSAIDs, many cats will be receiving other medications and the \u2018administration burden\u2019 may be daunting for owners, leading to incon- sistent dosing. To help long-term use, a drug should ideally be highly palatable and taken voluntarily by the cat \u2013 for example, in food or as a treat \u2013 and veterinary pharmaceutical companies undertake much research into this.65 Published studies suggest meloxicam liquid is highly palatable in cats,13,16 with one study suggesting it was significantly more palatable than ketoprofen tablets.16 Other drugs may be compounded in specific flavours that are appealing to individual cats. 526 JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs However, it is important to follow all regula- tions and compliance policies for drug com- pounding,66 which are different throughout the world, and to consider the potential effect of compounding on bioavailability and stability/ shelf-life. Additionally, owners must be consistent and remember to administer the drug. Based on the long duration of action of many NSAIDs in cats, this should be at a set time on treatment days. Creative reminder systems may help ensure cats receive medication on the correct day(s), at the correct time(s) and at the correct dose. Giving medication along with a daily food ration (which should also be done for safety) can provide a built-in reminder system for owners, and encourage owner involvement", "170": "in the monitoring process. Dosing \u2013 intervals, frequency, timing and the \u2018lowest effective dose\u2019 Short-term pharmacokinetic data are available for a number of NSAIDs in cats, which form a basis for dosing intervals. While many NSAIDs are metabolised via glucuronidation in the liver, and the relative deficiency of glucuronyl transferase enzymes in cats may lead to a prolonged half-life for some of these drugs,37,56 others, such as piroxicam and meloxicam,56,67 are metabolised by oxidation. Single doses of many approved/licensed NSAIDs for acute pain in cats seem to have a duration of action of around 18\u201320 h.56 However, it is not known if such prolonged pharmacokinetics are necessary for appropri- ate efficacy. For example, meloxicam and robenacoxib have a serum half-life of approx- imately 24 and 2 h, respectively,68,69 yet both have been shown to be effective for daily treatment of musculoskeletal pain in cats by virtue of their European licences. COX-2 selectivity Panel recommendations \u271cIn keeping with other species, studies of NSAIDs in cats suggest no difference in anti-inflammatory or analgesic efficacy between COX non-selective drugs and variably COX-2 selective inhibitors. \u271cIt is presumed, as in other species, that using drugs with a greater COX-2 selectivity in cats will help avoid some of the potential adverse effects associated with COX-1 suppression, such as GI irritation/ulceration and platelet inhibition. However, selective COX-2 inhibition will not completely negate the possibility of adverse effects and may not confer any renoprotective effect in comparison with a non-selective inhibitor. \u271cIt is presumed that dual inhibition of COX and LOX may be associated with reduced GI adverse effects over COX inhibition alone. However, it is unlikely that dual inhibition will completely negate the possibility of adverse effects. at University of Bristol on June 24, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE527 S P E C I", "171": "A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs For most of the NSAIDs used in cats, it is not known if repeated long-term dosing alters the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of the drug. In one study, the administration of flunixin daily for 7 days appeared to result in more rapid metabolism of the drug after 7 days and decreased pharmacodynamic effects,70 although the same did not appear to be evident during daily administration of meloxicam for 7 days.68 Additionally, informa- tion on the apparent efficacy of daily versus every-other-day or less frequent dosing is anecdotal, with no controlled studies yet pub- lished. Daily dosing of meloxicam at less than the labelled dose for a mean of 5.8 months was considered to be clinically effective and asso- ciated with minimal adverse effects in one non-blinded study,13 although efficacy was not measured objectively or with a validated assessment system. However, due to the inter- cat variability of pharmacokinetics with administration of a variety of NSAIDs, it is likely that daily dosing may be appropriate for some cats, while longer intervals might be appropriate for others. Unfortunately there is no practical way to determine which cats might be \u2018fast\u2019 metabolisers and which slower. Additionally, probably as a result of their high protein-bind- ing, which may enable NSAIDs to persist in inflamed tissue sites for longer than in plasma, the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity of these drugs often persists longer than would be predicted from their serum half-life. This may enable daily dosing even for drugs with a relatively short half-life.38,69 Indeed persistence at the site of inflammation has been demonstrated in an experimental study of robenacoxib in cats.67 It is, therefore, unlikely that a set mg/kg dose and dosing schedule will work equally well for all cats; furthermore, variations in the level of pain", "172": "may alter the cat\u2019s needs over time. Very little attention has been given to the best time of day to administer NSAIDs to cats to achieve the most beneficial effect, a concept termed chronotherapy.71 Theoretically, long-term dosing may result in a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic steady-state. However, \u2018peaks and troughs\u2019 may still occur. If the peak beneficial effect on lameness occurs at say 5 h after dosing, treat- ment may be tailored to achieve maximum clinical effect when the cat is most active. The timing, therefore, may depend on a cat\u2019s lifestyle. Alternatively, an owner may find that at \u2018peak effect\u2019 the cat is more comfortable, it rests for longer and may choose to administer the drug to promote resting and sleeping at the most suitable time for the household. Dosing \u2013 accuracy Dosing accuracy will depend on the formula- tion of the drug. Liquids are more easily measured, and can be delivered in small volumes. Thus incremental increases or decreases in dose are potentially more readily achieved. However, differing dispensing methods can potentially result in wide varia- tions in doses. Tablets or caplets are not Dosing frequency Panel recommendations \u271cTo avoid potential side effects, owners should be encouraged to work on titrating to the \u2018lowest effective dose\u2019 that works for their cat, with the understanding that this may change over time. This dose may often be less than the labelled dose.13,14,21 \u271cIn overweight or obese cats, it is prudent to calculate initial doses for NSAIDs according to their lean or ideal bodyweight. \u271cWhen attempting to reduce the overall dose of an NSAID, it would seem prudent to reduce the label dose but maintain the label frequency, where possible. \u271cThe panel recognise that intermittent therapy, for example 2\u20133 times weekly rather than daily, is better than no therapy at all, and", "173": "anecdotally appears efficacious in some cats. However, there may be a risk of significant periods of time when no effective therapy, or suboptimal therapy, is being achieved. \u271cIntermittent drug withdrawal, a reduced frequency of dosing, or a reduction of the dose may all help owners to assess drug efficacy. \u271cThe panel see little rationale for pulse therapy with NSAIDs unless the underlying disease process varies sufficiently in severity that it does not require consistent analgesic/anti-inflammatory therapy. Treatment may be tailored to achieve maximum clinical effect when the cat is most active. Alternatively, an owner may choose to administer the drug to promote resting and sleeping at the most suitable time for the household. at University of Bristol on June 24, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from Monitoring efficacy There is no validated assessment tool for acute or chronic feline pain, although studies are ongoing.72 In studies evaluating the efficacy of NSAIDs in cats with musculoskeletal pain, improved mobility, and in particular the will- ingness to jump and the height of the jump, have been the most obvious signs of improve- ment,13,21 and another study found increases in mobility with administration of an NSAID.15 One key feature of chronic pain assessment is owner involvement and obser- vation, especially as pain may manifest in different ways in individual cats.56,73 It has been postulated that four behavioural domains \u2013 mobility, activity, grooming and temperament \u2013 are particularly useful to both clinicians and owners in assessing chronic musculoskeletal pain and monitoring the response to therapy.23 When treating animals with long-term dis- eases, an overall assessment of \u2018quality of life\u2019 may be beneficial; this includes, but is not lim- ited to, pain. An assessment tool may need to be individually designed since what is impor- tant to each patient will be different: can the cat climb trees,", "174": "hunt, play with other pets in the household, and so on?15 This was the thinking behind the use of client-specific out- come measures in a recent study.15 Owners should keep a regular journal or diary of the cat\u2019s activities, as changes in mobility and behaviour may be subtle and occur slowly. The owner is the best person to judge and track the cat\u2019s behaviour and demeanour. It may only be obvious from consulting the \u2018diary\u2019 that a change in treatment is needed. 528 JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE always easy to divide and therefore delivering a small dose may be problematic and inaccu- rate. Intact tablets will provide a different dose to cats of different weights, which may not be a problem when the drug is licensed for a dose range, as for example robenacoxib, but may be a problem if a very precise target dose is required. Repeat subcutaneous injections may be another option in some cats and with some owners, although no NSAIDs are cur- rently licensed for long-term use by this route. Dosing \u2013 switching drugs There is little objective data available on the best way to transition therapy from one NSAID to another, and feline-specific infor- mation is lacking. There is concern about changing from aspirin to another NSAID in other species due to COX-2 dependent adap- tive mechanisms that may occur during thera- py.38,61 However, there is uncertainty about the need for or timing of any \u2018washout\u2019 period with other NSAIDs.38,61 S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs Dosing accuracy Panel recommendations \u271cLiquid formulations will provide for the most accurate dosing and dose adjustment of NSAIDs in cats; and manufacturers are encouraged to explore this route of delivery. \u271cThe use of a dedicated and clearly marked syringe for administration of the", "175": "liquid (Fig 8) should be encouraged to prevent accidental administration of excess drug when it is administered directly from a storage container. Switching between NSAIDs Panel recommendations \u271cAs a precaution, a \u2018washout\u2019 period of approximately 7\u201310 days should be used when switching from aspirin to another NSAID. \u271cA sensible precaution may be to allow a washout period of 3\u20135 days when switching between other NSAIDs, and potentially longer if the previous NSAID had a prolonged half-life. Additional adjuvant therapy with other analgesics should be considered if required during this time.

When renal haemo - dynamics are normal, prostaglandins appear to have a minimal role. In keeping with this, a recent study evaluating the effect of 5-day therapy with meloxicam in healthy adult cats showed no alteration in GFR based on iohexol clearance studies,74 and similarly in healthy cats undergoing anaesthesia there is evidence of its safety when standard care is taken to avoid hypovolaemia and hypotension.5 Under conditions of low effective renal blood flow, however, prostaglandins become crucial in maintaining renal function and GFR.

In humans, the risk of AKF is regarded as low, and can occur with both non-selective and COX-2 selective NSAIDs, although the risk may vary between individual agents.50,75\u201379 In general, the risks for NSAID-induced AKF in humans are higher with conditions causing renal hypoperfusion (eg, dehydration, hypo- volaemia, congestive heart failure), with old age (occult renal disease) and pre-existing renal disease, with concomitant drug therapy (eg, diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs]) and with higher doses of NSAIDs. The resultant AKF is usually reversible, provided it is detected in time.50,63,76,77,79\u201381 The use of NSAIDs also car- ries a small risk of inducing hyperkalaemia in human patients, which is higher in those with existing renal disease and those on potassium supplements.50,57,75 In human medicine, the role of NSAIDs in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is much less clear. While", "178": "some studies have suggested that NSAIDs may be a risk factor for developing CKD (so-called \u2018analgesic nephropathy\u2019),82\u201384 or in the progression of existing CKD,85 others have found no evidence of a causal associa- tion,86,87 and the difficulties in interpreting trial data have been highlighted.88 Where studies have suggested a link between CKD and NSAID use, the risk appears to be low, and may be exacerbated by heavy use of one or more NSAIDs.85,88,89 Two retrospective studies evaluated the safety of NSAIDs in a total of 76 older cats, including some cats with stable CKD. In both studies, cats received oral meloxicam (approx- imately 0.02 mg/kg/day) on a long-term basis for osteoarthritis. One study included three cats with International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) stage 3 CKD90 and an addition- al 10 cats without CKD that had serum creati- nine concentrations monitored,13 and the other included 22 cats with IRIS stage 1\u20133 CKD.14 Neither study showed any significant difference in the development or progression of renal dysfunction in treated cats, compared with age- and disease-matched controls, over an average period of 6 months13 or more than 1 year.14 Another study evaluated 73 cats that received oral piroxicam at an average dose of 0.2\u20130.3 mg/kg/day for between 1 and 38 months. In that study, no significant changes were seen in serum renal or hepatic param - eters within the first month of therapy in 43 cats that had follow-up samples collected.91 During prolonged therapy, five cases of renal insufficiency were detected in 58 cats receiv- Renal disease Panel recommendations \u271cBased on data from cats and other species, the risk of AKF developing during appropriate therapeutic NSAID use in cats is low and not abrogated by the use of COX-selective agents. \u271cMonitoring serum renal analytes and urine parameters before and after commencement of NSAID", "179": "therapy is highly recommended as a precaution, in an attempt to recognise AKF at an early stage should it occur (see section on monitoring). \u271cRisk factors for renal toxicity in humans are presumed to apply to cats. Where an increased risk of renal toxicity is anticipated the lowest effective dose should always be administered (which may be facilitated by the use of adjuvant analgesic therapy) and increased monitoring is prudent. \u271cNSAIDs should be administered with food, and therapy withheld if food is not eaten \u2013 see recommendations for GI disease. In cats predisposed to dehydration, such as with CKD, using a wet rather than dry diet is a sensible precaution to optimise water intake. \u271cSpecific risk factors, such as dehydration and hypovolaemia, should always be addressed before therapy is administered, and if analgesia is required in the interim period an alternative such as an opioid can be utilised. Care should be taken to ensure good renal perfusion is also maintained if anaesthesia is required during therapy. \u271cCurrent data suggest that at least some NSAIDs can be used safely in cats with stable CKD at judicious doses, and that this should not be a reason for withholding analgesic therapy when it is indicated. Further data, particularly in cats with advanced renal disease, would be valuable and such pharmacovigilance studies are vital. \u271cThe combination of cardiac disease and renal disease is problematic \u2013 care is urged with the use of NSAIDs in this situation due to the increased risks of AKF. The exploration of analgesic options other than NSAIDs may be prudent, but the potential risks of exacerbating these diseases should not restrict the use of analgesic therapy where it is needed. \u271cAs there is a risk of hyperkalaemia developing during NSAID therapy in other species, especially in the face of renal", "180": "failure or potassium supplementation, potassium monitoring is recommended during therapy. at University of Bristol on June 24, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE531 S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs ing piroxicam, but as other therapies were being received, as the cats had underlying neoplasia, and as they were an older popula- tion without any controls, it was impossible to know if any of these were related directly to piroxicam therapy.91 It has been demonstrated that cats with CKD have higher circulating levels of gastrin92 and, as such, these cats may be at increased risk of GI adverse effects when NSAIDs are used. Gastrointestinal disease Because of the physiological role of COX in maintaining the normal gastric mucosal barri- er, upper GI bleeding has been the most common serious complication associated with NSAID use in humans. Indeed, the GI tract has been considered the major site for NSAID toxicity in both humans and animals, includ- ing cats.13,16,21,48,57,93 In one study of the long-term use of piroxicam in 73 cats with neoplasia,91 vomiting was the most common- ly reported adverse effect (occurring in 16% in the first month), although there was evidence that other therapies (eg, chemotherapeutic agents) contributed to the reported preva- lence. During long-term use of oral meloxi- cam at a dose of 0.1 mg/cat, vomiting was reported in 2/46 cats (4%).14 Direct topical injury to the GI mucosa may also occur and contribute to adverse GI effects.38,59 Although studies in cats are lacking, in humans and other species, COX-1 has a major role in main- taining the mucosal integrity. However, COX- 2 expression is also thought to be important, especially for repair of injured mucosa.48,49,94,95 Factors that have been recognised as increasing the risks of GI adverse events in humans include", "181": "higher doses of NSAIDs, the specific NSAID used, increased age, previous NSAID-associated GI disease, liver disease, pre-existing GI ulcers, and concurrent anti - coagulant or glucocorticoid use.57,59,63,77 Some of these risk factors have also been noted in dogs.38 In humans, the two main strategies to prevent GI adverse events with NSAIDs are to use COX-1 sparing drugs, and/or a combina- tion of an NSAID and a mucosal protectant such as a prostaglandin analogue (eg, miso- prostol) or a proton-pump inhibitor (eg, omeprazole).49,57,59,62,63,77 In cats, NSAID-asso- ciated gastric and intestinal ulceration and perforation is recognised and, in the current absence of species-specific studies, data from humans are considered relevant.56 Cardiovascular disease Inhibition of COX activity by NSAIDs can have a number of potential adverse cardiovas- cular effects in humans. These are uncommon or rare, but include occasional exacerbation of congestive heart failure (CHF) and/or hyper- tension due to water and salt retention mediat- ed by COX-1 and COX-2 suppression in the kidneys; reduced platelet aggregation and bleeding as a result of inhibition of COX-1 mediated platelet thromboxane production; and thromboembolic disease due to inhibition of COX-2 mediated endothelial prostacyclin production.77,96\u201398 While ex vivo inhibition of platelet thromboxane has been demonstrated for a number of NSAIDs in cats, studies have not been able to demonstrate a clinically ben eficial effect in preventing thromboembolic disease, or in promoting unwanted bleed- ing.56,99 Currently, there are no data on the potential effects of NSAID therapy on blood pressure or CHF in cats, or on whether COX-2 selective agents may have a prothrombotic effect in certain individuals, such as those with a propensity to develop thromboembolism. Gastrointestinal disease Panel recommendations \u271cIt is assumed that, as in other species, COX-1 sparing NSAIDs may have a better safety profile than non-selective agents. As GI pain and discomfort may", "182": "be difficult to detect clinically, the panel recommend the routine use of COX-1 sparing NSAIDs for long-term therapy in cats. \u271cNSAIDs should routinely be given with, or after, food in cats. Inappetence or anorexia may be an early sign of adverse GI events; hence withholding therapy in an inappetent patient is prudent. Furthermore, inappetent or anorexic cats are far more likely to become dehydrated, which would increase the risks of renal adverse events if therapy were to be continued. Cardiovascular disease Panel recommendations \u271cThe risks of NSAID therapy in feline cardiovascular disease are unknown. \u271cThe panel recommend that, based on human studies, hypertensive cats receiving NSAID therapy should have their blood pressure monitored regularly. Patients with congestive heart failure should also be monitored carefully, and the NSAID use should be titrated to the lowest effective dose. \u271cGiven the relatively high prevalence of thromboembolic disease in cats, whether long-term use of highly selective COX-2 inhibitors might increase this risk, as has been recognised in humans, deserves further investigation. at University of Bristol on June 24, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from 532 JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs Liver disease In humans, NSAID-induced hepatotoxicity is an uncommon or rare event. It is regarded as an idiosyncratic reaction mediated by hyper- sensitivity or a metabolic aberration, possibly as a result of genetic polymorphism, although with salicylates it has a predictable dose- dependent occurrence.77,100,101 The risk of this may be higher in patients receiving other potentially hepatotoxic drugs and varies between different NSAIDs, with toxicity usu- ally developing within the first 6\u201312 weeks of therapy.100\u2013102 Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity has also been reported in dogs receiving NSAIDs.103 Severe hepatotoxicity following clinical use of NSAIDs has not been reported in cats, although this may simply reflect the lower", "183": "prevalence of NSAID prescribing in this species.56 Although NSAIDs are metabolised by the liver, pre-existing liver disease does not appear to predispose to NSAID-induced hepatotoxicity.38 As drug metabolising path- ways are often well preserved in liver disease, withholding NSAID therapy in such patients may not necessarily be required without evidence of significant liver dysfunction,38 although reducing doses in severe/advanced liver disease is recommended in humans.104 In humans, pre-existing advanced liver disease may be a risk factor for NSAID-associated renal and GI adverse events.63,81 NSAIDs and concomitant drug therapy Glucocorticoids Concomitant use of glucocorticoids and NSAIDs carries a well-characterised increased risk for adverse GI events in humans and dogs,38,56 with an estimated 2- to 15-fold greater risk for peptic ulcer disease in humans.59,63 Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics The use of ACEIs (and/or angiotensin recep- tor antagonists) and/or diuretics along with an NSAID carries a well-recognised risk for development of acute NSAID-associated renal adverse events in humans,63,75,81,105 and there is evidence of a higher risk when all three drugs are used together.105 Both ACEIs and NSAIDs may individually result in altered renal haemodynamics and reduced GFR, thus together the risk may be compounded, and the use of diuretics may lead to volume depletion and a greater renal dependence on prostaglandins to maintain GFR.105 Anticoagulants Although COX-1 inhibiting NSAIDs may sup- press platelet thromboxane production and reduce platelet aggregation, clinically signifi- cant bleeding as a result of this is rare in humans and, to date, has not been reported in cats.56,61,63 However, NSAIDs may appreciably potentiate the effect of warfarin, and other highly protein-bound drugs, through compet- itive protein binding63 and the use of these drugs together should be avoided. Liver disease Panel recommendations \u271cDue to the rare potential for NSAIDs to cause hepatotoxicity in other species, routine biochemical monitoring, including", "184": "liver enzymes, of cats receiving long-term NSAID therapy is recommended. \u271cDose-reduction (titration) should be considered in cats with pre-existing liver disease. In the presence of severe liver dysfunction (eg, as evidenced by moderate to severely elevated bile acids), and/or hypoalbuminaemia (of any cause), NSAIDs should be used with extreme caution, if at all. Concurrent drug therapy Panel recommendations \u271cThe panel recommend that concurrent use of NSAIDs and glucocorticoids should be avoided whenever possible. For short-acting glucocorticoids, a \u2018washout\u2019 period of around 5 days may be appropriate before starting an NSAID,61 but longer times should be given when long-acting steroids have been used. \u271cBecause NSAIDs are highly protein-bound and have the potential to displace other protein-bound drugs, concurrent use of protein-bound drugs with a low margin of safety, such as warfarin, digoxin, anticonvulsants such as phenobarbitone, and chemotherapeutic agents, should be pursued with great care, if at all. \u271cBased on data from other species, it is likely that the concomitant use of ACEIs and/or diuretics with NSAIDs will increase the risk of renal adverse effects. Appropriate care is needed if using such combinations, with increased monitoring and the use of the lowest effective NSAID dose. The use of analgesics such as opioids should be explored as alternatives to NSAIDs, or to help minimise the dose of NSAIDs required. at University of Bristol on June 24, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from JFMS CLINICAL PRACTICE533 S P E C I A L ARTICLE / ISFM/AAFP guidelines on NSAIDs Monitoring cats receiving long-term NSAID therapy Adverse drug events (ADEs) related to NSAID use most commonly affect the GI system, liver, kidneys and platelet function, but lessons learned from the long-term use of these agents in dogs suggest that this class of drug is often used inappropriately and without screening and monitoring.106 While the need for,", "185": "and benefit of, NSAID therapy in many situations is clear, screening and monitoring is important for the clinician, owner and patient, to help minimise the like - lihood of ADEs occurring. Until further data become available, especially from pharmaco - vigilance studies, suggested protocols for screening and monitoring cats on long-term NSAID therapy have to be based on a knowl- edge of the use of these drugs in both animals and humans, and it is important that protocols are adapted to the individual needs of the patient. Testing and screening before treatment Thorough patient evaluation before commenc- ing therapy is crucial, with a view to identify- ing concurrent conditions or therapies that may impact on NSAID administration, and allowing informed client consent to be obtained. Screening during treatment In dogs, most NSAID-related ADEs occur between 14 and 30 days (range 3\u201390) after the start of treatment.107 However, it is recognised that the time for an ADE to develop is extreme- ly variable, probably being dependent on the individual drug, the dose and the individual patient. In humans, hepatotoxicity is usually reported within the first 6 months of therapy, with more than 60% of cases reported in the first 3 months,102 whereas acute renal failure is usual- ly reported early, often within the first few days or weeks of commencing drug administration.78 Based on appropriate use of NSAIDs in other species, the prevalence of ADEs is low in healthy patients. However, the frequency of certain ADEs increases in some patient groups, and these can therefore be classified Screening before therapy Panel recommendations \u271cA thorough history and physical examination is mandatory in all cats prior to commencement of NSAID therapy, paying particular attention to conditions and therapies that may impact on NSAID therapy. Wherever possible this should include blood pressure measurement (Fig", "186": "9). \u271cIdeally, the physical examination should be accompanied by laboratory testing. Laboratory evaluation should focus on the renal and hepatic systems, along with plasma proteins and haematocrit (see Table 2). The latter parameters may be surrogate markers of GI bleeding and/or mucosal damage. This aids in identifying potential problems and establishes a baseline for later comparison. \u271cAbnormalities identified in the clinical examination and on laboratory testing do not necessarily preclude the use of NSAIDs, but the risks and benefits of embarking on therapy must be discussed with the owner, and concurrent diseases may affect subsequent monitoring recommendations.

This approach enables treatment and monitoring plans to be adjusted according to perceived risks.57,59,60,62,63,81 Critically, ADEs are typically reversible with prompt recognition and inter- vention. Categorising patients as having a higher or lower risk of ADEs has clear benefits and should be equally applicable to cats, although at present this has to be based large- ly on knowledge of ADEs in other species, due to the lack", "187": "of feline-specific data. Classification of patients Panel recommendations Clinical recognition of patients that may have an increased risk of an ADE relating to NSAID therapy is important \u2013 not necessar- ily to avoid therapy, but to encourage more cautious dosing and increased relevant monitoring. Based primarily on experience in human medicine, the panel cautiously suggest that more vigilant monitoring may be required in the following situations: \u271cAn increased risk of renal ADEs may be anticipated in cats with functional volume depletion (renal hypoperfusion, including that associated with hypotension during anaesthesia); older cats (eg, >8\u201310 years of age); cats with concurrent cardiovascular, renal or hepatic disease; and cats receiving concurrent therapy with ACEIs, diuretics and \u03b2-blockers. As in humans, there may be a greater risk of NSAID-induced hyperkalaemia in patients receiving potassium supplements. \u271cAn increased risk of GI ADEs may be anticipated in cats that are older; have had a previous history of NSAID-induced GI signs; have renal disease; are receiving glucocorticoid or anticoagulant therapy; have a history of GI disease; or have concurrent liver or other serious disease. \u271cAn increased risk of hepatic ADEs may be anticipated in cats that are older; have renal disease; or are receiving multiple drug therapies. \u271cAn increased risk of cardiovascular ADEs may be anticipated in cats that are older; have hypertension; or have pre-existing renal or cardiac disease. Particular care should be taken with unstable disease such as congestive heart failure or thromboembolic disease. \u271cThe panel recommend that, where NSAIDs are used in patients with perceived higher risks of developing ADEs, greater care is taken, efforts are made to use the lowest effective dose, and increased monitoring is undertaken (see Table 2). Monitoring during therapy Panel recommendations \u271cMonitoring should take place routinely while cats are on NSAID therapy (Table 2), but the panel recognise", "188": "that the extent of monitoring will be affected by many factors, including the presumed risk for the individual patient, financial constraints and owner compliance. Furthermore, multiple visits to the veterinary clinic can be stressful for some cats. Any recommendations have to be adjusted to individual situations. \u271cInvolvement of owners in monitoring therapy is crucial. Owners need to be made aware of signs that should prompt cessation of therapy and/or the need for veterinary advice. Ideally a client leaflet, such as the one that accompanies these guidelines (Fig 10), or one supplied by the drug manufacturer, should be used to reinforce such information. \u271cTo reduce the potential for ADEs, the panel suggest that NSAID therapy is always given with or after food. If the cat does not eat then therapy should be withheld. \u271cAn initial reassessment of all cats is recommended after the first 5\u20137 days of therapy, and sooner if there is concern. Although rare, acute renal failure can be life threatening and can be seen within the first few days of therapy. In some cases a telephone conversation with the owner may suffice. \u271cA routine re-evaluation of all cats (Table 2) is recommended after the first 2\u20134 weeks of NSAID therapy. Thereafter, the frequency of re-evaluation should be based on perceived risks and patient characteristics. \u271cFor \u2018lower risk\u2019 patients, the panel recommend that a re-evaluation (Table 2) should generally take place at least every 6 months. \u271cFor \u2018higher risk\u2019 patients, the panel recommend that re-evaluation (Table 2) should generally take place every 2\u20136 months, depending on the perceived risks. \u271cThe potential risk of ADEs is a dynamic process, and at each visit the veterinarian should reassess the patient status based on the history, physical examination \u00b1 laboratory data and determine the most appropriate ongoing monitoring.

These drugs are commonly used in humans and animals to help relieve pain, fever and inflammation \u2013 most commonly associated with degenerative joint disease. Controlling your cat\u2019s pain is crucial for its welfare. Many cats greatly benefit from these drugs, having better mobility, less pain, increased appetite and an improved quality of life. Degenerative joint disease (DJD) in cats Degenerative joint disease (including osteoarthritis) is common, especially in older cats. As with other conditions, cats may mask the signs of this disease. Problems and behaviour changes in cats with DJD include: \u27a1Decreased activity \u2013 eg, sleeping more, not moving around as much, playing or hunting less \u27a1Decreased mobility \u2013 eg, reduced willingness to jump, not jumping as high, difficulty using the litter tray, stiffness, and sometimes obvious lameness \u27a1Decreased grooming \u2013 reduced time or difficulty grooming, a poor coat, overgrown claws \u27a1Altered personality \u2013 less keen to interact with people or pets, seeking solitude, \u02bbgrumpier\u02bc \u27a1Other signs \u2013 may include aggression or vocalisation when touched and loss of appetite Understanding these changes helps alert you and your vet to the possible existence of pain and DJD, and will help you monitor whether therapy is helpful or not. Are NSAIDs safe in cats? NSAIDs play a vital role in therapy for many cats, but differences between cats and other animals mean you should only ever use a drug that has been specifically prescribed for your cat by your veterinarian. Many human drugs such as aspirin,", "190": "ibuprofen and paracetamol/acetaminophen can be highly toxic to cats \u2013 administering these is life-threatening. Adverse effects can be seen with NSAIDs, just as with all drugs. Some patients may be at increased risk of adverse effects (eg, older cats and cats with certain other diseases). Your veterinarian may then recommend increased monitoring and careful adjustment of therapy to find the lowest effective dose of the drug for your cat.

Licensed NSAIDs have been shown to be safe for use in cats. However, adverse effects can still occur. Most are mild, but some can be serious \u2013 as in other species they may involve the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, cardiovascular system or liver. Adverse effects may lead to a number of signs including: \u27a1Loss of appetite \u27a1Nausea or vomiting \u27a1Lethargy and dullness/depression \u27a1Altered thirst and/or urination \u27a1Diarrhoea and/or black-coloured faeces \u27a1Yellowing of the skin, gums, or whites of the eyes What do I need to know? \u2714Make sure you understand how much of the drug to give, how frequently, and for how long. If you are unsure, ask your veterinarian. \u2714Always give the medication with or after food. Your vet may suggest feeding canned rather than dry food to help encourage good fluid intake, as maintaining a good fluid intake is important. \u2714If your cat does not eat DO NOT give the medication.

If adverse GI events are observed, NSAID therapy should be withheld, and appropriate supportive therapy introduced, until any mucosal lesions have healed. If therapy is re-instituted, it should be done so at the lowest effective dose with consideration given to the concomitant use of omeprazole (0.7\u20131.0 mg/kg PO q24h) or misoprostol (5.0 \u00b5g/kg PO q8h),99,108 and/or a different NSAID where licensing permits. Hepatotoxicity or acute renal failure are usu- ally reversible in other species on drug with- drawal and appropriate supportive therapy, providing they are detected early enough \u2013 this emphasises the importance of patient monitor- ing and of ensuring clients are involved in this process. In humans, it is recommended that a three-fold increase in ALT should lead to cessa- tion of NSAID therapy. Milder increases may prompt more attentive monitoring, with further investigations being warranted if the ALT fails to return to baseline concentrations.57 Re-institution of alternative NSAID therapy after hepatotoxicity or acute renal failure should be done very cautiously. Increases in blood pressure have been documented in other species with NSAID therapy, and this should be monitored in cats \u2013 antihypertensive thera- py or more intense antihypertensive therapy should be used as appropriate.

The rationale for the administration of different analgesics is discussed in each case. Case description Case 1 A 5.3 kg 8-year-old male neutered domestic shorthair (DSH) was presented with caustic burns after acciden\u00ad tally stepping on spilled drain-cleaning product 5 days earlier. The lesions affected all feet, including foot pads, and superficial and deep soft tissues. Approximately 24 h before, the referring veterinarian had administered ketoprofen and meloxicam in close", "204": "temporal association. On admission to OVC, the cat was ambulatory and pre\u00ad sented with moderate lameness and minimal response to palpation of the limbs. In the emergency setting, intra\u00ad muscular (IM) buprenorphine (0.02 mg/kg) was given and used as part of the anesthetic premedication. Prior to, and under, general anesthesia for wound debride\u00ad ment and repair, blockade of the distal branches of the radial, ulnar, median, common peroneal and tibial nerves was performed with bupivacaine 0.5% (2.5 mg per limb), according to the technique described else\u00ad where.2 Necrotic skin, tendons and multiple phalanges were removed during surgery. Prior to extubation, a sec\u00ad ond dose of buprenorphine (0.02 mg/kg) was adminis\u00ad tered intravenously (IV). During anesthetic recovery, the cat was given medetomidine (1.7 \u03bcg/kg IV) owing to emergence delirium. Five hours postoperatively, a con\u00ad stant rate infusion (CRI) of fentanyl was started (1\u20133 \u03bcg/ kg/h IV) for the next 36 h. The cat was then adminis\u00ad tered buprenorphine again (0.01\u20130.02 mg/kg IV PRN) until hospital discharge (28 days later). Pain assessment was performed by the attending clinician and trained staff, and was based on the cat\u2019s behavior and response to gentle palpation of the limbs.

The purpose of this article is to highlight the use of perioperative multimodal analgesia and the need to individualize the treatment plan based on the presenting condition, and to adjust it based on the response to analgesia for a given patient. This case series presents the alleviation of acute pain in three cats undergoing different", "205": "major surgical procedures. These cases involved the administration of different classes of analgesic drugs, including opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, tramadol, ketamine, gabapentin and local anesthetics. The rationale for the administration of analgesic drugs is discussed herein. Each case presented a particular challenge owing to the different cause, severity, duration and location of pain. Pain management is a challenging, but essential, component of feline practice: multimodal analgesia may minimize stress while controlling acute perioperative pain. Individual response to therapy is a key component of pain relief in cats.

Two weeks after the first inter\u00ad vention, a second surgical procedure was carried out for skin grafts. Premedication, induction agents and local blocks were the same as used in the first anesthetic epi\u00ad sode. Meloxicam (0.1 mg/kg SC) was administered intraoperatively and continued for 4 days postopera\u00ad tively (0.05 mg/kg SC q24h) (Figure 1). Case 2 A 4 kg 13-year-old male neutered DSH was presented for permanent epicardial pacemaker placement and hemi-mandibulectomy after previous diagnostic work- up. No signs of pain-related behaviors were observed or noted during physical examination. The cat was pre\u00ad medicated with butorphanol (0.4 mg/kg IV) and induc\u00ad tion of anesthesia was performed with a combination of ketamine (5 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.25 mg/kg). Lidocaine 2% (20 mg) was infiltrated in the subcutane\u00ad ous (SC) tissue for temporary pacemaker placement via the jugular vein. One and a half hours later, fentanyl (2", "206": "\u03bcg/kg bolus IV; 5\u201315 \u03bcg/kg/h IV CRI) was started for the surgical procedure. An intercostal nerve block was performed by infiltrating 1.25 mg of bupivacaine 0.5% in each of the two adjacent intercostal nerves cra\u00ad nial and caudal to the left fourth intercostal space where the surgical incision was made.2 The permanent epicar\u00ad dial pacemaker placement was performed via thoracot\u00ad omy followed by a right hemi-mandibulectomy via a ventral approach. Anesthe\u00ad tic recovery was uneventful. Postoperative analgesic drugs included the administra\u00ad tion of meloxicam (0.1 mg/kg SC q24h for 48 h), keta\u00ad mine (2\u201316 \u03bcg/kg/min IV CRI for 24 h) and fentanyl (2\u20134 \u03bcg/kg/h IV CRI for 16 h). The patient was eating well and seemed to be comfortable at discharge 2 days after surgery. Tramadol (2.5 mg/kg PO q8\u201412h) and meloxicam (0.04 mg/kg PO q24h) were prescribed for 5 days (Figure 2). Case 3 A 9 kg 13-year-old male neutered DSH was presented for evaluation of a 2-week history of right hind limb lame\u00ad ness and stifle joint instability that were consistent with a cranial cruciate ligament rupture. The cat expressed behavioral signs of pain, such as growling with attempts to escape during palpation of the affected pelvic limb. The cat was admitted for stabilization of the right stifle by performing a right lateral extra-capsular suture tech\u00ad nique. Hydromorphone (0.04 mg/kg) was administered IM as part of the anesthetic premedication. Under gen\u00ad eral anesthesia, an epidural injection with morphine (0.1 mg/kg) and bupivacaine (0.8 mg/kg) was performed; meloxicam (0.08 mg/kg SC) was administered pre- emptively. The surgical procedure lasted for 45 min. Two hours after recovery from anesthesia the cat showed signs of discomfort, including restlessness and vocaliza\u00ad tion. The animal was extremely reactive to touch of the surgical wound area and became extremely aggressive while rolling around the", "207": "cage. A dose of hydromorphone (0.05 mg/kg IM) was administered, but failed to improve manic reaction of aggression. The clinicians hypothe\u00ad sized that clinical signs were possibly related to central sensitization and wind-up pain.

A CRI of fentanyl (2\u20133 \u03bcg/kg/h IV) was instituted for the following 18 h. The cat returned to its normal behavior and appeared to remain comfortable until hospital discharge. The fenta\u00ad nyl CRI was stopped and buprenorphine (0.02 mg/kg IV PRN) was administered for the subsequent 18 h. Prescribed treatments included meloxicam (0.05 mg/kg PO q48h for 5 days) and buprenorphine (8 \u03bcg/kg buc\u00ad cally q8h for 2 days).

This is challenging in any veterinary teach\u00ad ing hospital where a single case may be dealt by several different specialists. This report emphasizes the pros and cons of each analgesic therapy, and their combinations employed herein. Opioid drugs produce analgesia by binding to opioid receptors within the central and peripheral nervous sys\u00ad tem. They are the cornerstone for the treatment of", "209": "acute and postoperative pain if one considers their efficacy, safety margins and versatility.3 Buprenorphine is a par\u00ad tial agonist at \u00b5 opioid receptors that binds avidly to, and dissociates slowly from, these receptors.4 The drug was administered to the cat described as case 1 at presen\u00ad tation owing to its provision of long-term moderate analgesia with few adverse effects.5,6 However, buprenor\u00ad phine does not elicit a maximal clinical response as a full agonist. Therefore, had the clinicians known that sur\u00ad gery was recommended immediately, a fentanyl CRI would have been a better option because it provides dose-dependent analgesia as a full-agonist, it can be titrated to effect in order to produce inhalant anesthetic- sparing effects and it may be easily administered for postoperative analgesia. The fentanyl infusion was initi\u00ad ated approximately 5 h after buprenorphine administra\u00ad tion in an attempt to minimize an interaction with buprenorphine; the mixing of opioid analgesics may produce antagonistic properties and interfere with opti\u00ad mal pain relief as discussed below. The IV route was cho\u00ad sen for administration of buprenorphine after discontinuation of fentanyl CRI because recent studies have shown that the drug provides better anti-nocicep\u00ad tion after IV administration, and has a faster onset of action, when compared with SC or IM administration.7 Following induction of anesthesia, \u2018declaw\u2019 blocks, as described previously, were performed to provide anal\u00ad gesia and prevent central sensitization in case 1; this technique has been performed in combination with other analgesic modalities in cats undergoing onychectomy.2 Pre-emptive analgesia (ie, administration of agent before the noxious event) may help to reduce the total amount of anesthetics needed during surgery, as well as anes\u00ad thetic-induced cardiopulmonary depression and the postoperative analgesics required. Local anesthetics are ideal for providing pre-emptive analgesia as these com\u00ad pounds inhibit nervous impulse generation and conduc\u00ad tion by", "210": "reversibly blocking voltage-dependent sodium channels, thus blocking the transmission of nociceptive input to the spinal cord, and inhibiting central sensitiza\u00ad tion.8 These drugs are relatively safe when appropriate doses and techniques are used, albeit central nervous system and cardiovascular toxic effects may be observed when accidentally administered IV or greater than rec\u00ad ommended amounts are used.9 In all the cases described herein, toxic doses were calculated and care was taken to ensure that IV administration did not occur. Indeed, close monitoring of patients is essential when adminis\u00ad tering local anesthetics at dosages that are close to the ones considered to be toxic for that species. The same cat received medetomidine during anes\u00ad thetic recovery and shortly after extubation. The \u03b12 adr\u00ad energic agonists are sedatives with muscle relaxant and analgesic properties that are widely used in veterinary medicine.10 In our experience, small doses of (dex) medetomidine can be used to treat emergence delirium and/or dysphoria after general anesthesia in healthy cats. Transient increases in systemic vascular resistance with reflex bradycardia and further decreases in cardiac output are usually observed after \u03b12 adrenergic adminis\u00ad tration. Therefore, their use should be restricted to ani\u00ad mals that can tolerate such cardiovascular effects.11 Gabapentin was administered to cat 1 as neuropathic pain was suspected owing to damage of nerve endings and because the drug has been shown to decrease post\u00ad operative opioid requirements in humans.12 This drug has been used widely in the treatment of neuropathic pain, although its mechanism of action is not fully eluci\u00ad dated, and doses are commonly based on anecdotal reports.13 In cats, the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin have been determined;14 it seems to be effective as an adjuvant analgesic in the treatment of acute pain.15 Increasing doses of up to 50 mg/kg PO have been rec\u00ad ommended.13 Gabapentin may be", "211": "used adjunctively in the treatment of hyperalgesia and allodynia in order to potentiate the effect of other analgesic drugs.15 Fourteen days after presentation, cat 1 required a sec\u00ad ond surgical intervention, and the anesthetic and analge\u00ad sic protocols were similar to the first episode. At this time, meloxicam was administered for treatment of post\u00ad operative pain for 4 days. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are popular for their anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. Their analgesic effects are secondary to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase enzymes in cell membranes.16 In healthy cats, short-term administration of NSAIDs has not been correlated with adverse effects,17 although this may not be the case in cats with naturally-occurring disease in the clinical set\u00ad ting. Cats have limited hepatic glucuronidation and con\u00ad sequent NSAID metabolism,18 which may induce the development of adverse effects, such as gastric irritation, hepatic and renal damage, and inhibition of platelet aggregation.19 Meloxicam was chosen as part of the pain management protocol as a recent study in cats has shown that its metabolites are products of oxidative metabo\u00ad lism, and excretion occurs primarily via feces.20 This drug was given to all cases with no detectable clinical side effects. In case 1, previously to the first anesthetic episode, the cat had been administered two different NSAIDs in close temporal association and, for this at UNIV OF GUELPH on February 4, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from Steagall and Monteiro-Steagall 5 reason, NSAID treatment was withheld initially. Although a wash-out interval when switching NSAIDs has not been validated, the use of two NSAIDs in close temporal association is contraindicated.21 In case 2, lidocaine was infiltrated in the SC tissue before temporary pacemaker placement via the jugular vein to minimize surgical stimulation and provide anal\u00ad gesia. Prior to the thoracotomy, an intercostal block was performed as part of the", "212": "multimodal analgesic regimen. A mandibular block could have been beneficial prior to the hemi-mandibulectomy, but other analgesic tech\u00ad niques were preferred owing to the risk of seeding neo\u00ad plastic cells.22 Butorphanol is an\u03baagonist and a \u00b5 opioid receptor antagonist that provides mild and short-acting analgesic effects.23 The drug was administered as part of the anes\u00ad thetic premedication in case 2 because temporary pace\u00ad maker placement was deemed to cause only mild pain. Retrospectively, a fentanyl or remifentanil CRI would have been a better option to start with in order to avoid a possible opioid interaction between butorphanol and fentanyl. The clinicians tried to minimize this interaction by initiating the fentanyl CRI approximately 1.5 h after butorphanol administration, when the effects of butor\u00ad phanol were likely to be wearing off.23 In laboratory set\u00ad tings there has been controversy as to whether or not administration of an agonist\u2013antagonist with a pure \u00b5 agonist will diminish analgesic efficacy.24,25 However, mixing full, partial and/or agonist-antagonist opioids should be avoided whenever possible as these combina\u00ad tions may provide less than optimal analgesic effects and unpredictable pain relief in the clinical setting. Intraoperative fentanyl reduces inhalant anesthetic requirements potentially resulting in less cardiopulmo\u00ad nary depression while also providing analgesia.26 Doses of fentanyl were titrated in case 2 depending on require\u00ad ment with lower doses being used to provide the con\u00ad scious cat with analgesia while higher doses were given during surgery in response to painful manipulations. An NSAID and ketamine CRI were combined with fentanyl for postoperative analgesia. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic used commonly in cats. This drug is a non- competitive antagonist of N-methyl D-aspartate recep\u00ad tors involved in the transmission and modulation of nociceptive stimuli in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, a key player in neuropathic and chronic pain.27 As part", "213": "of a multimodal approach, ketamine has shown to improve postoperative analgesia in dogs undergoing forelimb amputation.28 In this case, ketamine CRI was used as an adjunctive analgesic agent in order to mini\u00ad mize the risk of central sensitization, potentially decreas\u00ad ing opioid requirements. Two days after surgery the same cat was discharged from hospital and prescribed tramadol and meloxicam for 5 days. Tramadol has weak binding affinity at \u00b5 receptors, and also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.3 Subcutaneous administration of trama\u00ad dol has limited effect on nociceptive thresholds29 while providing adequate analgesia in cats undergoing ovario\u00ad hysterectomy.30 However, oral administration of trama\u00ad dol provides high oral bioavailability while peak concentrations were reached within 45 mins; doses of 2\u20134 mg/kg induced significant thermal anti-nociception in cats, possibly making it useful for feline postoperative pain control following hospital discharge.31,32 In cats, dysphoria has been observed after injectable tramadol;29 single administration of the drug does not alter hemato\u00ad logic or biochemical parameters or gastrointestinal func\u00ad tion.19 In this patient, tramadol did not appear to cause any side effects. The drug was combined with meloxi\u00ad cam because a combination of tramadol-NSAID has been shown to produce superior analgesic efficacy than either treatment alone.19 The cat described in case 3 was premedicated with hydromorphone, which is a full agonist at \u00b5 opioid receptors. This drug may be a good option in the clinical setting owing to its low cost, lack of inducing histamine release after IV administration (as may be caused by morphine), high efficacy and long duration of anti- nociceptive effects.33 Hydromorphone has, however, been observed to cause post-anesthetic hyperthermia in cats34 and vomiting,5 similar to other opioids. None of these side effects were observed in this patient. Nonetheless, we recommend close temperature moni\u00ad toring in cats receiving hydromorphone. In our experi\u00ad", "214": "ence, the administration of this opioid as supplemental analgesia is common in cats undergoing orthopedic sur\u00ad gery; in this patient, however, it failed to provide ade\u00ad quate pain relief. It was hypothesized that the cat had possibly developed central sensitization, which has been reported to occur after intensive nociceptive input and subsequent release of excitatory neurotransmitters. Also known as windup, this phenomenon may be manifested clinically as an exaggerated pain response to low- intensity stimuli or so-called allodynia.35 Epidural administration of local anesthetics and/or opioids can be used to provide sensory and motor nerve blockade caudal to the diaphragm, such as in abdominal and orthopedic surgeries.2 This technique has been used in combination with general anesthesia to reduce anes\u00ad thetic requirements, and improve analgesia and muscle relaxation,36 and was considered to be adequate in case 3. The use of local anesthetics was also performed post- operatively when the cat showed severe signs of pain, and an intra-articular injection of bupivacaine was per\u00ad formed. The latter procedure has been shown to provide superior analgesia when compared with intra-articular morphine in dogs following stifle surgery.37 In our expe\u00ad rience, the analgesic plan used in case 3 has been suc\u00ad cessful and efficacious in the treatment of perioperative at UNIV OF GUELPH on February 4, 2013 jfm.sagepub.com Downloaded from 6 Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery 0(0) pain after orthopedic surgery in cats. The lack of analge\u00ad sic efficacy may have been owing to individual variabil\u00ad ity in response to a set dose of a specific analgesic treatment. The long-term administration of most of NSAIDs is still considered an off-label treatment in the cat. In some countries (European Union), meloxicam is licensed for long-term use at 0.05 mg/kg/day, and several stud\u00ad ies38,39 have supported its safe use when used at low doses (0.01\u20130.03", "215": "mg/kg/day) in the long term. In case 3, the administration of meloxicam at lower than labeled doses was an attempt to use the lowest effective dosage while ensuring adequate analgesia.40 In all cases, close monitoring was recommended to owners, who were fully informed about off-label administration of NSAIDs and the possible side effects. The use of multimodal therapy for the treatment of pain in cats is of utmost importance; opioids are consid\u00ad ered to be the mainstay of acute pain management used in combination with local anesthetic blocks and NSAIDs. Other classes of analgesics (eg, gabapentin, tramadol, ketamine CRI) may be administered for specific condi\u00ad tions as alternative adjuvants. Critical pain recognition and assessment is a key component to tailor analgesic treatment to the individual needs on a case-by-case basis. The literature suggests that there are likely to be genetic differences between individuals and response to therapy in cats.41 Multimodal analgesia did not produce undesirable therapeutic effects in the present case series; however, awareness that drug interactions may lead to side effects is warranted. For example, opioids may pro\u00ad duce bradycardia and dose-dependent respiratory depression in cats that becomes more pronounced with co-administration of anesthetic agents and/or sedatives in patients undergoing general anesthesia.3 Conclusions This case series reported the successful treatment of acute pain in three cats using a multimodal approach. Pain management is a challenging, but essential, component of feline clinical practice, and multimodal analgesia may minimize stress while controlling perioperative acute pain. Rational administration of analgesic drugs may vary according to the cause, severity, duration and loca\u00ad tion of pain, as well as differences between individual patients. Future investigations may provide a clear understanding of the potential side effects after the com\u00ad bined administration of analgesic drugs.

Conclusions Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs should be used with caution in cats because of their low capacity for hepatic glucuronidation, which is the major mechanism of metabolism and excretion for this category of drugs. However, the evidence presented supports the short-term use of carprofen, \ufb02unixin, ketoprofen, meloxicam and tolfenamic acid as analgesics in cats. There were no data to support the safe chronic use of NSAIDs in cats. Keywords cat, kinetics, non-steroidal anti-in\ufb02am- matory drug, pain, pharmacology. Introduction The most widely used analgesics in veterinary, as well as human, medicine are nonsteroidal anti- in\ufb02ammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which target per- ipheral and central nervous system (CNS) mediators of nociception (McCormack 1994; Hinz & Brune 2004). They have been found to be effective in alleviating acute and chronic pain in most species. The acceptance of NSAIDs in small animal practice increased dramatically in the 1990s, with the realization that they could play an important role in the management of", "221": "perioperative pain (Reid & Nolan 1991; Nolan & Reid 1993; Lascelles et al. 1994), and with the introduction of several new NSAIDs. Currently, several NSAIDs (aspirin, car- profen, cinchophen, deracoxib, etodolac, \ufb01rocoxib, \ufb02unixin, ketoprofen, meloxicam, phenylbutazone, tepoxalin, tolfenamic acid and vedaprofen) have approval for the control of canine perioperative and/ or chronic pain in various countries. However, the availability of approved NSAIDs for use in cats is very much more restricted. There are probably multiple reasons for the relative paucity of approved NSAIDs for cats, but this is unlikely to be due to lack of conditions to treat, or lack of evidence of ef\ufb01cacy of NSAIDs in treating pain in cats. In the USA there are approxi- mately 69 million cats (Wise et al. 2002) and an estimated 10 million in the UK. The majority of these undergo at least one operative procedure in their lifetime; neutering. A variety of NSAIDs have been shown to be effective ameliorators of peri- operative pain in the cat (Lascelles et al. 1995a; Balmer et al. 1998; Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 1998, 2000). Although no prospective studies have been performed, degenerative joint disease appears to be radiographically detectable in a signi\ufb01cant proportion of the feline population (Hardie et al. 2002; Godfrey 2005), in perhaps up to 90% of cats 228 Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia, 2007, 34, 228\u2013250 doi:10.1111/j.1467-2995.2006.00322.x over 12 years old (Hardie et al. 2002). Although debated (Herzog et al. 2004), many feline patients probably do suffer pain associated with degenerative joint disease. The incidence of other painful disor- ders such as intervertebral disc disease (Jaeger et al. 2004) and neoplasia is unknown, but undoubtedly signi\ufb01cant. Although NSAIDs are considered to be effective for chronic pain in the cat, there is little evidence of this presumed ef\ufb01cacy (Lascelles et al. 2001). The most likely", "222": "reasons for the relative lack of licensed or approved NSAIDs for use in the cat are the: \u2022 Problems assessing pain in cats and therefore knowing when NSAIDs may be required; \u2022 Assumption by pharmaceutical companies that the market for NSAIDs in cats is not \ufb01nancially viable; \u2022 Increased risks of toxicity associated with NSAID use in cats; \u2022 Relative lack of information about NSAID use in cats. It is widely recognized that NSAIDs should be used with caution in cats because of their low capacity for hepatic glucuronidation (Hietanen & Vainio 1973; Court & Greenblatt 2000), which is the major mechanism of metabolism and excretion for this category of drugs. However, there is a signi\ufb01cant body of evidence in the literature regarding the use of NSAIDs in cats, which demonstrate their value and safety in this species, particularly the newer compounds. This manuscript reviews this evidence-based medicine. As the use of NSAIDs increases in cats, often based on anecdotal reports, it is timely and important to review the scienti\ufb01c information regarding NSAID use in cats. Role of NSAIDs in multimodal analgesia Together with the concept of pre-emptive analgesia (Woolf & Chong 1993; Lascelles et al. 1995b; Moiniche et al. 2002), over the last 15 years, the concept of \u2018multimodal analgesia\u2019 has created important advances in the approach to providing analgesia in both acute (Rockemann et al. 1996; Skinner 2004) and chronic pain (American Pain Society 2002) in humans. The basis for this multi- modal drug approach stems from recent advances in our understanding of pain. Particularly important are the laboratory \ufb01ndings that different classes of analgesics are synergistic when combined (Penning & Yaksh 1992). Pain transmission involves a multi- plicity of pathways, mechanisms and transmitter systems (Woolf & Chong 1993; Mannion & Woolf 2000; Muir & Woolf 2001) so", "223": "it is expected that using several different drugs acting on multiple components of the nociceptive system would be more effective than a single therapy. No multimodal analgesic studies have been performed in cats, but clinical observations suggest that it will be effective (Robertson 2005). The most recent survey of peri- operative analgesia in general veterinary practice describes signi\ufb01cant use of both preemptive and multimodal analgesia (Williams et al. 2005). There is no published scienti\ufb01c evidence that multimodal drug therapy is of bene\ufb01t over mono-modal therapy in veterinary patients suffering from osteoarthritis. Pharmacology of NSAIDS The principle therapeutic effects of the NSAIDs, including reduction of fever, pain and in\ufb02ammation, derive primarily from the ability of these drugs to inhibit the production of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid by the cyclooxygenase (COX) en- zymes (Lees et al. 2004a,b; Warner & Mitchell 2004). Two distinct COX isoforms (COX-1 and COX-2) have been identi\ufb01ed that are the products of two separate genes (Warner & Mitchell 2004). COX-1 is expressed constitutively in most tissues (but not erythrocytes) leading to production of prosta- glandins, important for many normal physiological functions. This includes regulation of gastrointesti- nal (GI) and renal blood \ufb02ow as well as a role in blood clotting, through the synthesis of thrombox- ane A2 in platelets (Warner & Mitchell 2004). In contrast, COX-2 is an inducible enzyme that is expressed at sites of in\ufb02ammation in response to in\ufb02ammatory mediators (such as interleukin-1). COX-2 is also expressed in some neoplasms in response to mitogens (such as the phorbol esters). However, this is a rather simplistic description, as COX-1 and COX-2 are known to be both con- stitutively expressed and inducible. For example, there is evidence that COX-1 and COX-2 are con- stitutively expressed in the CNS, particularly in the spinal cord, where they are involved in", "224": "modulating nociceptive signaling in both neuropathic (non- in\ufb02ammatory) and in\ufb02ammatory pain states (Ito et al. 2001; Warner & Mitchell 2004). COX-2 is also constitutively expressed in the kidney and repro- ductive system. The majority of NSAIDs act by competitive inhibition of the COX enzymes, so the effects are reversible once drug concentrations decrease when Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs in cats: A review BDX Lascelles et al. \u0002 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation \u0002 2007 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 34, 228\u2013250 229 drug dosing is discontinued. The exception to this is aspirin, which, in addition to competitive inhibition, irreversibly inhibits COX through acetylation of a serine residue near the enzyme\u2019s active site (Catella- Lawson et al. 2001). Consequently, new enzymes must be synthesized before function is restored. Platelets are unable to synthesize new enzymes, accounting for the prolonged anticoagulant effect of aspirin. The mechanism of action of acetaminophen (contraindicated in cats) is still unknown. Its antipyretic and analgesic effects may result primarily from COX inhibition in the CNS (Chandrasekharan et al. 2002; Davies et al. 2004; Graham & Scott 2005). A common strategy employed in the development of novel NSAIDs has been to identify drug candi- dates that selectively inhibit COX-2 with minimal effect on COX-1 (Lees et al. 2004a,b; Warner & Mitchell 2004; Giraudel et al. 2005). This is based on the rationale that the therapeutic drug effects are primarily mediated via COX-2, while the unwanted drug side effects (particularly renal and GI damage, and inhibition of platelet function) result mainly from COX-1 inhibition. Consequently, various in vitro and in vivo assays have been developed to evaluate the selectivity of COX-2 versus COX-1 inhibition (Lees et al. 2004a), and the COX ratios reported. This ratio is calculated by dividing the concentration of a drug that will inhibit the COX-1 enzyme by", "225": "a given amount (usually 50%, the IC50) by the concentration of a drug that will inhibit the COX-2 enzyme by a similar amount. Larger values represent more COX-2 selectivity. Although few studies have been conducted, results from whole blood enzyme assays indicate that there may be signi\ufb01cant species differences in the relative COX-1 or COX-2 selectivity of certain drugs. For example, while (R,S-) carprofen is somewhat COX-2 selective in dogs (COX ratio 6.5) and cats (5.5), it is essentially nonselective in horses (1.9) and may even be COX-1 selective in humans (0.02) (Brideau et al. 2001). Consequently such pharmacodynamic studies need to be performed in the species for which the drug is intended and data should not be extrapolated between species. Unfortunately, while there are substantial COX selectivity data for humans, and to a lesser extent, dogs, there are few published studies of cats. Apart from the previously referenced work, a recent study by Giraudel et al. (2005) determined COX ratios using cat whole blood for meloxicam (3.5) and S-carpro- fen (28) (Giraudel et al. 2005). However, aside from species differences, COX ratio values can vary with the in vitro system used for analysis, and the in vivo extrapolation of such data to drug safety is depend- ent on many other factors such as drug disposition and other pharmacodynamic interactions. It is also important to note that, even if COX-2 is mainly induced in one species, it may play an important constitutive role in another species. Ideally, for each species, knowledge of COX selectivity and also the normal physiology of COX in the tissue concerned should be known. Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs may also interact directly or indirectly with enzymes other than COX, which may account for both additional bene\ufb01cial and adverse drug effects. In particular, COX inhibition can lead to", "226": "alternative processing of accumulated arachidonic acid via the 5-lipoxyge- nase (5-LOX) pathway to proin\ufb02ammatory and gastrotoxic leukotrienes (Alvaro-Gracia 2004). Several novel NSAIDs including licofelone and tepoxalin are dual inhibitors of COX and 5-LOX (Alvaro-Gracia 2004; Agnello et al. 2005). Initial studies in humans and dogs suggest that these drugs may have very good GI safety pro\ufb01les, perhaps resulting from additional 5-LOX inhibition (Bias et al. 2004; Agnello et al. 2005; Moreau et al. 2005). As yet, there are no published studies of these drugs in cats to support this contention. NSAID disposition in cats Most NSAIDs are cleared from the body through metabolism in the liver (often primarily glucuroni- dation) and then excretion of the resultant polar metabolites via the bile and/or kidney. Given the known propensity for reduced glucuronidation of drugs in cats compared with other species (Robin- son & Williams 1958; Yeh et al. 1971; Davis & Westfall 1972; Miller et al. 1973; Savides et al. 1984; Wilcke 1984; Jernigan 1988; Court & Greenblatt 2000), differences in NSAID disposition between cats and other species might be expected. Table 1 compares available elimination half-life data for NSAIDs that have been studied in both cats and dogs. Aspirin, acetaminophen, and carprofen have relatively prolonged elimination half-lives in cats compared with dogs, most likely as a result of slower drug clearance via glucuronidation. In con- trast, similar or even reduced drug elimination half- lives are observed in cats, compared with dogs, for drugs cleared by oxidative enzymes, including piroxicam and meloxicam.

However, it is not yet clear to what extent glucuronidation con- tributes to total drug clearance of either of these compounds in dogs or cats. Elimination of un- changed \ufb02unixin through organic anion transport- ers into the bile has been implicated as a major mechanism determining drug clearance in cats (Horii et al. 2004). Furthermore, thioesteri\ufb01cation is proposed as a major elimination mechanism for ketoprofen in cats (Castro et al. 2000). Conse- quently, the presence of alternate metabolic and nonmetabolic pathways for drug elimination may compensate for slowed glucuronidation of NSAIDs and other drugs in cats. Knowledge of the clearance of drugs in the target species is important in designing safe dosing regimens in that species. Adverse effects of NSAIDS in cats Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory agents represent the largest group of drugs associated with adverse drug experiences (ADE) reported to the US Federal Drug Administration\u2019s Center for Veterinary Medicine (FDA/ CVM) (http://www.fda.gov/cvm/ ade_cum.htm \u2013 accessed April 9, 2006). In dogs, the most commonly reported ADE are related to the GI (64%), renal (21%) and hepatic systems (14%) (Hampshire et al. 2004). Unfortunately, the clinical circumstances", "229": "surrounding such ADE reports are not available, making this information dif\ufb01cult to interpret. Currently there is less published infor- mation relating to feline ADE, probably because only one NSAID is currently licensed for use in cats in the United States (Meloxicam, Metacam; Boeh- ringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc., St Joseph, MO, USA) and this has been available for <1 year. However, under the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Act of 1994 in the USA, any NSAID approved for hu- man or veterinary use can be legally used in cats on an \u2018extra-label\u2019 basis. Renal effects Prostaglandins are important for normal renal function via their regulation of vascular tone, blood \ufb02ow, salt and water balance and renin (Cheng & Harris 2005). During normovolemic conditions re- nal prostaglandin synthesis is low. However, when the circulating blood volume or systemic blood pressure is decreased (such as after trauma and in the perioperative period), renal prostaglandins play an important role in regulating and maintaining renal blood \ufb02ow. They promote vasodilation to counteract the vasoconstrictor responses to angio- tensin II and norepinephrine and the vasoconstric- tion resulting from sympathetic nervous stimulation. These mechanisms allow autoregula- tion of renal blood \ufb02ow over a mean arterial pres- sure range from 60 to 150 mmHg (Cohen et al. 1983). There are species-related differences in suscepti- bility to NSAID-induced renal toxicity (Khan et al. 1998) which may be associated with the expression of COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms in the kidney (Khan et al. 1998, 2002). Khan et al. (1998) demonstra- ted that both isoforms are expressed in the kidney of dogs, rats, monkeys, and humans. However, there were marked differences in localization and basal expression. COX-2 is constitutively expressed in normal kidney and in addition to the importance of COX-1-produced prostaglandins, COX-2-synthesized prostaglandins also play a signi\ufb01cant role in renal physiology.", "230": "The important role played by COX-2 is most likely the reason that COX-2-selective drugs in humans have not improved the renal safety pro\ufb01le and must be used cautiously (Cheng & Harris 2005). Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs impair renal autoregulation under conditions of hypo- volemia and hypotension, and the resultant decrease in renal blood \ufb02ow and function may lead to acute renal failure and death, as has been reported in both dogs and cats (Elwood et al. 1992; Pages 2005). Volume depletion resulted in a marked increase in COX-2 expression in rats and dogs, but not in monkeys (Khan et al. 1998), con\ufb01rming that NSAID studies must be species speci\ufb01c. Currently, nothing is known about COX-1 and COX-2 distribution or expression under different conditions in the feline kidney. Perioperative use of NSAIDs in humans reduced creatinine clearance and potassium output, but these transient changes in renal function were considered clinically unimportant (Lee et al. 2004). Decreased creatinine clearance has also been reported in dogs receiving NSAIDs in the perioper- ative period (Forsyth et al. 2000), but neither meloxicam nor carprofen altered glomerular \ufb01ltra- tion rates when administered preoperatively in healthy dogs (Crandell et al. 2004). To our know- ledge similar studies have not been performed in cats. One retrospective study evaluated cats that Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs in cats: A review BDX Lascelles et al. 232 \u0002 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation \u0002 2007 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 34, 228\u2013250 presented, or were referred, for acute renal failure (Pages 2005). A total of 48 cases were evaluated, and in 21, the cause was considered to be NSAID administration. Most animals (19) had been given a single dose, and the NSAIDs administered were nimesulide (16 cases), tolfenamic acid (three cases) and ketoprofen (two cases). Although nimesulide is not routinely used in cats in most", "231": "countries, this study does suggest that renal toxicity caused by NSAIDs may occur relatively easily in cats. How- ever, details of the cats\u2019 renal function prior to administration of the NSAID were not available, and the author states that acute renal failure, caused by NSAIDs, is uncommon (Pages 2005). In countries including the United Kingdom and Can- ada where NSAIDs such as carprofen and meloxi- cam have been available for use in cats for many years and are routinely administered pre-opera- tively, clinically detectable renal side effects appear to be rare when used in healthy cats as a single dose. However, repeated use (off-label) of meloxi- cam has been associated with acute renal failure in the cat, and the company\u2019s website warns about repeated dosing (http://www.bi-vetmedica.com/ product_sites/METACAMINCats/reference.html \u2013 accessed April 9, 2006). Hepatic effects Idiosyncratic drug-induced hepatotoxicity is a rare, but potentially serious, adverse consequence asso- ciated with many classes of drugs, including NSAIDs, volatile anesthetics, antibiotics, anti- hypertensives, and anticonvulsants. It can occur with all NSAIDs, but is most frequently associ- ated with diclofenac and sulindac in humans (O\u2019Connor et al. 2003). In dogs, hepatotoxicity has been associated with repeated use (for 5\u2013180 days) of carprofen (MacPhail et al. 1998). However, it is not yet clear whether this is speci\ufb01c to carprofen as no comparative studies, with different NSAIDs, have been conducted. A review of the current lit- erature did not identify any reports of NSAID he- patotoxicity in cats, possibly re\ufb02ecting the relatively smaller number of cats that are treated with these drugs compared with dogs. However, it should be mentioned that one leading hypothesis explaining NSAID hepatotoxicity is that reactive acyl glucuronide metabolites are generated that can covalently bind and haptenize hepatocyte proteins, thereby promoting an immunological re- sponse in the liver (Boelsterli et al. 1995; Boelsterli", "232": "2002; Bailey & Dickinson 2003). Under this sce- nario, reduced NSAID glucuronidation in cats would minimize this mechanism. Acetaminophen overdose typically results in serious liver injury in humans and dogs, but is manifest in cats primarily as methemoglobinemia and Heinz body anemia, probably because of enhanced susceptibility of feline erythrocytes to oxidative injury compared with other species (Harvey & Kaneko 1976). Gastrointestinal effects Several studies and reviews have suggested that a variety of risk factors may lead to GI ulceration in dogs (Stanton & Bright 1989; Sullivan & Yool 1998; Hinton et al. 2002; Lascelles et al. 2005). NSAID administration is one of the risk factors, and several reports indicate that GI ulceration can also occur in cats treated with NSAIDs (Whittle et al. 1985; Jones et al. 1992; Runk et al. 1999). Al- though the mechanisms are not well understood in any species, the main factor is thought to be NSAID-induced impairment of prostaglandin- dependent mucosal-protective mechanisms via inhibition of COX. In the cat, COX inhibition is an important mechanism underlying deep gastric ulceration induced by aspirin (Konturek et al. 1981a,b; Whittle et al. 1985) and where indo- methacin-induced ulceration was prevented by the concomitant administration of topical prostaglan- din E2 (PGE2), those of aspirin were only attenuated (Pendleton & Stavorski 1983), suggesting that the exact mechanism of gastric ulceration in cats may differ between compounds. Both an intravenous (IV) H2 receptor antagonist and also IV pros- taglandin I2 signi\ufb01cantly reduced the formation of experimental aspirin-induced gastric ulcers in cats (Konturek et al. 1981b). It has been shown that, in the cat duodenum, local prostaglandins regulate HCO\u0002 3 transport. These prostaglandins have a simi- lar, but less important role in the cat stomach, and the NSAID indomethacin decreases bicarbonate secretion in both sites (Smeaton et al. 1983). COX-1 inhibition", "233": "is considered to be the cause of reduced bicarbonate secretion, reduced mucus formation and adverse vascular effects, all of which may lead to GI ulceration and possible perforation. However, the mRNA for COX-2 protein appears to be pre- sent in the canine GI tract (Wilson et al. 2004), although the role of COX-2 protein at this site is currently unknown. Work in rodents using acid or chemically-induced gastric ulceration has shown Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs in cats: A review BDX Lascelles et al. \u0002 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation \u0002 2007 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 34, 228\u2013250 233 that selective COX-2 inhibitors can delay or prevent healing of the ulcers (Mizuno et al. 1997; Beren- guer et al. 2004), and analysis of COX-2 expression and localization indicated that COX-2 expression was upregulated during injury and was localized to reparative epithelium at the periphery of the wound. Nothing is known about the role of COX-2 in the feline gastric and/or duodenal mucosa and there is also very little information about possible risk factors for feline NSAID-associated GI ulcer- ation. It is known that parietal cells of the feline gastric mucosa are highly sensitive to gastrin (more so than the dog or human) (Hirst et al. 1980), and cats with various degrees of renal failure have sig- ni\ufb01cantly higher circulating gastrin concentrations than cats without renal failure which may predis- pose them to ulceration (Goldstein et al. 1998). Only carprofen has been evaluated for its ulcero- genic properties in feline gastro-duodenal tissue. A single dose of carprofen was evaluated in \ufb01ve cats, and no erosions were detectable by endoscope 8 hours after injection (Parton et al. 2000). The concurrent administration of NSAIDs and cortico- steroids led to more severe GI toxicity in dogs (Dow et al. 1990; Boston et al. 2003). Although no", "234": "studies have been performed in cats, the same is considered to be true. Clotting function Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs affect hemo- stasis through effects on platelets and vascular epithelium. Platelets are activated and after activa- tion (by exposure to arachidonic acid, collagen, thrombin, or adenosine diphosphate), their aggre- gation depends on formation of thromboxane A2 from arachidonic acid within each activated plate- let. COX-1, within the platelet, catalyses this reac- tion and COX-1 inhibition can be bene\ufb01cial by preventing undesirable thrombosis, but undesirable if excessive bleeding occurs. Intact vascular epithe- lium produces prostacyclin, limiting the spread of a platelet plug and helping to prevent intravascular initiation of clotting. COX-2 catalyzes this reaction (Jones & Budsberg 2000), therefore COX-2 inhibi- tion may lead to increased thrombosis, particularly if the NSAID is a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor, with no action on COX-1 (Egan et al. 2004; Das 2005). Aspirin has been studied for deliberate use as an anticoagulant in cats (see below) and the negative effect of other NSAIDs (ketoprofen, meloxicam) on clotting has been examined in the context of surgery. There are no published studies evaluating the effect of chronic administration of COX-2 selective drugs on the incidence of vascular thrombosis in cats. Speci\ufb01c drugs Acetaminophen (paracetamol) Acetaminophen is one of the most commonly used drugs for mild pain and fever in humans, and is used to a limited extent in other species (off-label use). However, for several reasons, clinical use is contraindicated in cats. Firstly, the therapeutic index of acetaminophen in cats is very small. Acetami- nophen doses as low as 60 mg kg)1 (one 325 mg acetaminophen capsule) resulted in severe toxicity in cats characterized by anorexia, vomiting, depression, methemoglobinemia, and Heinz body anemia (Savides et al. 1984). In contrast, more than \ufb01ve times this dose (300 mg kg)1) was", "235": "requi- red to produce toxic effects in dogs (Savides et al. 1984). Secondly, acetaminophen elimination kin- etics in cats are not linear at therapeutic doses, so drug accumulation and associated toxic effects may occur with repeated dosing. Elimination half-lives were shown to increase from 0.6 to 4.8 hours with doses from 20 to 120 mg kg)1 in cats, while a rel- atively constant half-life of 1.2 hours was demon- strated with doses of up to 200 mg kg)1 in dogs (Savides et al. 1984). Due to the low feline capacity to glucuronidate acetaminophen there is an increa- sed reliance on drug sulfation for detoxi\ufb01cation. Once the sulfation pathway becomes saturated an alternate cytochrome P450 pathway is utilized, producing the highly reactive acetaminophen meta- bolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). Although normally detoxi\ufb01ed by glutathione con- jugation, excessive NAPQI overwhelms glutathione availability, leading to oxidative injury (Allison et al. 2000). Accidental or intentional administration of acet- aminophen is a common cause of toxicity in cats (Finco et al. 1975; Sundlof 1990; Jones et al. 1992; Villar et al. 1998). Clinical signs include cyanosis, depression, facial swelling, salivation, and vomiting. The main treatment is administration of the gluta- thione precursor, N-acetylcysteine, as well as symp- tomatic and supportive care (Gaunt et al. 1981; Villar et al. 1998). Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs in cats: A review BDX Lascelles et al. 234 \u0002 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation \u0002 2007 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 34, 228\u2013250 Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) Pharmacokinetics and COX selectivity Following administration, aspirin is rapidly hydro- lyzed by esterases to salicylic acid, the major circu- lating active metabolite (Williams et al. 1989). Aspirin is more potent than salicylic acid as it can irreversibly inhibit COX via covalent acetylation (Patrono 1989). Consequently, in most tissues COX function will need to be restored through synthesis of", "236": "new enzymes. However, as platelets are unable to synthesize new enzymes, COX function is perma- nently inactivated in these cells. Clearance of salicylic acid is primarily via conjugation with glucuronic acid, as well as with glycine. There is also renal excretion of unchanged salicylic acid (Davis & Westfall 1972; Davis 1980). The pharmacokinetics of aspirin in cats following both oral and intraven- ous administration include a relatively slow salicylic acid clearance (4\u20135 mL kg)1 hour)1) and a pro- longed elimination half-life (22\u201345 hours) compared with other species (Davis & Westfall 1972; Davis 1980; Parton et al. 2000). As a consequence, the recommended aspirin dose is smaller and dosing interval longer in cats than in other species. Label doses Although no aspirin preparations have been ap- proved by the FDA in the USA for use in cats (or any other animal), a variety of formulations intended for humans are available for extra-label use. A variety of aspirin formulations are currently marketed in the USA for use in veterinary patients with label indications that include treatment of pain, fever, and in\ufb02ammation. However, it should be pointed out that none of these veterinary preparations have been speci\ufb01cally approved by the FDA. An oral dose of 10 mg kg)1 every 2 days has been recommended for pain and fever in cats, while higher doses of 10\u2013 25 mg kg)1 every 1\u20132 days could be used for in\ufb02ammation with appropriate monitoring for GI toxicity (http://www.usp.org/pdf/EN/veterinary/ aspirin.pdf \u2013 accessed May 23, 2006). Evidence of ef\ufb01cacy Aspirin is the NSAID that has been most studied with regard to clotting in cats. The aim was to \ufb01nd a dose of aspirin that would prevent thrombosis associated with cardiomyopathy and heartworm disease, but not result in toxicity. Results have been somewhat con\ufb02icting (Piegras et al. 1976; Gryg- lewski et", "237": "al. 1978) but overall, aspirin failed to predictably prevent thrombosis associated with vascular injury in the cat unless administered in extremely high doses (Schaub et al. 1982). Greene found that 25 mg kg)1 of aspirin inhibited arachi- donic acid-induced platelet aggregation (measured using platelet-rich plasma) for 3\u20135 days in the cat, and recommended that an average weight cat be treated with a 90 mg aspirin tablet twice a week to prevent thrombus formation (Greene 1985). Sub- sequent work has reported results that vary depending on the assay method used or the condi- tion being treated (Piegras et al. 1976; Gryglewski et al. 1978; Schaub et al. 1982; Allen et al. 1985; Rawlings 1990; Rawlings et al. 1990; Hart et al. 1995; Behrend et al. 1996; Bright et al. 2003; Smith et al. 2003). A retrospective study examining the survival rate and recurrence of arterial throm- boembolism in cats treated with high-dose aspirin (>40 mg/cat every 72 hours) and low-dose aspirin (5 mg/cat every 72 hours), showed no signi\ufb01cant difference between groups, but fewer side effects in the low-dose group (Smith et al. 2003). Collectively, these studies demonstrated limited inhibition of platelet aggregation with aspirin, even at doses of 20\u201325 mg kg)1. As yet, there are no published studies that have evaluated the ef\ufb01cacy or safety of aspirin for the treatment of pain, fever, or in\ufb02am- mation in cats. Toxicity Gastric ulceration occurs readily when aspirin is administered to cats (25\u2013100 mg kg)1 daily), and the incidence appeared to have little relation to the dose administered (Bugat et al. 1976). Accidental overdose of aspirin is a relatively common cause of poisoning in cats (Sundlof 1990; Jones et al. 1992). Clinical signs of acute overdose may include depression, vomiting, hyperthermia, electrolyte dis- turbances, metabolic acidosis, bleeding disorders, convulsions, coma, and death (Villar", "238": "et al. 1998). Treatment involves gastric lavage, urinary alkali- nization to enhance excretion, and symptomatic and supportive therapy (Villar et al. 1998). Recommended doses For treatment of pain, in\ufb02ammation, and fever, aspirin recommended doses range from 10 to Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs in cats: A review BDX Lascelles et al. \u0002 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation \u0002 2007 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 34, 228\u2013250 235 25 mg kg)1 administered orally every 24\u201348 hours (Wilcke 1984). Carprofen Pharmacokinetics and COX selectivity Carprofen was one of the \ufb01rst of the newer NSAIDs to be studied in cats, and pharmacokinetic and limi- ted pharmacodynamic data are available (Taylor et al. 1996; Parton et al. 2000). There is no infor- mation on pharmacokinetics following repeated dosing (in common with most other NSAIDs in the cat) and this is not generally recommended because of the very variable inter-cat pharmacokinetics; one study found that the half-life varied from 9 to 49 hours (Parton et al. 2000) (see Table 1). Car- profen is relatively slowly absorbed from the subcu- taneous site, with a Tmax of approximately 3.4 hours (Taylor et al. 1996). Carprofen is a racemic mixture, with both R()) and S(+) enantiomers included in a 1:1 ratio. The S(+) enantiomer is believed to be the most active (Lees et al. 2004b). It has been sugges- ted that carprofen causes limited COX inhibition (Taylor et al. 1996) which may explain its anecdo- tally good safety record following widespread clinical use in cats. One study suggested it was a preferential COX-2 inhibitor in a feline whole blood assay (Brideau et al. 2001). This study did not compare it to other NSAIDs that have been used clinically in the cat. A more recent study also found carprofen to be a preferential COX-2 inhibitor (Giraudel et al. 2005), and con\ufb01rmed previous", "239": "suggestions that selectivity is progressively lost at larger doses. At the dose li- censed in Europe (4 mg kg)1), these investigators predict 100% inhibition of COX-2, and 44% inhibi- tion of COX-1 (Giraudel et al. 2005). These results and predictions are based on a whole blood assay of activity against COX-1 and 2 isoenzymes. Nothing is known about its ability to inhibit COX enzymes in GI or renal tissue in vivo, and neither is there any information on the clinical toxicity of carprofen in cats. Label doses In countries where it is approved for use in cats (United Kingdom, France, Germany, The Nether- lands, Italy, Belgium, Australia, and New Zealand) it is labeled for the control of perioperative pain as a single injection, and a dose of 4 mg kg)1, is administered subcutaneously or intravenously. Evidence of ef\ufb01cacy In contrast to the paucity of information on the side effects (a feature common to all the NSAIDs), there are several clinical studies demonstrating its ef\ufb01cacy. The \ufb01rst reported study to evaluate carprofen in the cat (Lascelles et al. 1995a) found it to be a very effective analgesic in 30 cats undergoing ovario- hysterectomy, providing profound and prolonged analgesia (for the 20 hours of postoperative assess- ments) compared with meperidine (pethidine). In this randomized study, using a single observer visual analog score (VAS), the cats receiving carprofen exhibited less pain postoperatively overall, with 4.0 mg kg)1 being the most effective dose, although in the later postoperative period, all doses of carpro- fen (1, 2, and 4 mg kg)1) provided greater analgesia than both low- and high-dose meperidine as well as placebo (Lascelles et al. 1995a). Other studies have con\ufb01rmed these \ufb01ndings in clinical cases undergoing ovariohysterectomy (Balmer et al. 1998), and also found carprofen to be a more effective analgesic than buprenorphine", "240": "in orthopedic surgery (Mollenhoff et al. 2005) and butorphanol in ovariohysterectomy (Al-Gizawiy & Rude 2004). Subsequent clinical stu- dies have con\ufb01rmed the analgesic ef\ufb01cacy of car- profen (Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 2000, 2002; Al-Gizawiy & Rude 2004; Mollenhoff et al. 2005). One study (Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 2000) compared the ef\ufb01cacy of various NSAIDs in the prevention of acute pain. Forty cats, undergoing ovariohysterectomy, were assigned to carprofen (4 mg kg)1, SC), meloxicam (0.2 mg kg)1, SC), ketoprofen (2 mg kg)1, SC), or tolfenamic acid (4 mg kg)1, SC) groups. Pain was assessed using a single-observer VAS, and there was no difference between groups. One cat in each of the meloxicam, tolfenamic acid and ketoprofen groups required res- cue analgesia. Nine of ten cats per group had good overall scores at 18 hours. There was no difference between groups in mechanical threshold at the incision site, measured using a \ufb01nger-mounted pressure transducer (Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 2000). In a later study (Slingsby & Waterman- Pearson 2002), 80 cats undergoing \ufb02ank ovario- hysterectomy were assigned to carprofen (4 mg kg)1) or meloxicam (0.3 mg kg)1) SC before surgery. Pain was assessed by a single observer, using a VAS over 20 hours, and there were no signi\ufb01cant differences between groups. Two cats in the meloxicam group and one cat in the carprofen group required rescue analgesia. Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs in cats: A review BDX Lascelles et al. 236 \u0002 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation \u0002 2007 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 34, 228\u2013250 Toxicity There have been anecdotal reports of carprofen toxicity, generally associated with concurrent dis- ease and prolonged administration of the oral for- mulation, and one case report describes such a scenario (Runk et al. 1999). One study found no endoscopically visible GI lesions in eight cats fol- lowing a single dose of carprofen", "241": "(Parton et al. 2000). Carprofen did not appear to affect renal function adversely, as measured by urea and cre- atinine levels (Lascelles et al. 1995a) and none of the cats developed acute renal failure as a result of the combination of surgery, anesthesia, and the analgesic regimen. Recommended doses From a critical evaluation of the published infor- mation available, the authors recommend using carprofen only as a single dose, pre- or postopera- tively (depending on the hemodynamic status of the cat), at a dose of 1\u20132 mg kg)1 (subcutaneously or intravenously). This dose should maximize the safety margin, while maintaining clinically detect- able ef\ufb01cacy. Celecoxib, rofecoxib, and valdecoxib Currently there are three different COX-2-speci\ufb01c drugs that have been approved by the FDA in the USA for use in humans. Rofecoxib was recently withdrawn from sale because of a possible enhanced risk of cardiovascular thrombosis with long-term use. Although not approved for use in animals, the perceived safety of these drugs in humans has led to off-label use in other species, including studies investigating their ef\ufb01cacy and safety in companion animals (Moreau et al. 2005). As yet, no studies have been published evaluating the ef\ufb01cacy, safety, or pharmacokinetics of these drugs in cats. Deracoxib Pharmacokinetics and COX selectivity The pharmacokinetics of a single 1 mg kg)1 oral dose (compounded as an oral suspension) have been studied in healthy cats (Gassel et al. 2006) using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography assay (Cox et al. 2005). Oral bioavailability could not be calculated as an intravenous formulation was not administered for comparison. The half-life (T1/2) reported in cats was 8.4 hours which is much longer than the 3 hours reported in dogs after a 2\u20133 mg kg)1 dose (http://www.deramaxx.com/ content/ProductLabel.pdf \u2013 accessed July 21, 2006). The changes in hematological (decreased hemato- crit and albumin)", "242": "and biochemical values (de- creased total calcium) in this study were thought to be a result of blood collection for pharmacokinetic analyses (Gassel et al. 2006). Label doses Deracoxib is not approved for use in the cat. Evidence of ef\ufb01cacy, toxicity, recommended doses To date, no safety or ef\ufb01cacy studies have been performed in cats and currently deracoxib cannot be recommended for this species. Firocoxib Pharmacokinetics and COX selectivity Firocoxib was recently approved in the USA and Europe for alleviation of pain associated with osteo- arthritis in dogs. There is little information about its characteristics or use in cats. In one study of COX selectivity, using 19 experimental cats (McCann et al. 2005), it was administered at 2 mg kg)1 IV, or 3 mg kg)1 orally and using a whole blood assay, was found to be a selective COX-2 inhibitor. Its half- life was determined to be 8.7\u201312.2 hours. Label doses Firocoxib is not approved for use in the cat. Evidence of ef\ufb01cacy Doses of 0.75\u20133 mg kg)1 attenuated fever when administered to cats 1 or 14 hours before challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (McCann et al. 2005). Given its relatively short half-life, and its ef\ufb01cacy against LPS-induced fever, the authors concluded that it may be a suitable anti-in\ufb02amma- tory drug for once daily dosing in cats. Toxicity There is no information on toxicity. Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs in cats: A review BDX Lascelles et al. \u0002 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation \u0002 2007 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 34, 228\u2013250 237 Recommended doses Given the current sparse information on \ufb01rocoxib, the authors cannot recommend its clinical use in cats. Flunixin Pharmacokinetics and COX selectivity Flunixin is well absorbed from the GI tract and undergoes enterohepatic circulation, resulting in a bioavailability >100% (McKellar et al. 1991; Taylor et al. 1994). The Tmax after", "243": "oral dosing is approximately 1.3\u20132 hours (Taylor et al. 1994). The elimination half-life has been found to be 1\u20131.5 hours, using an assay with a limit of detection of 0.25 lg mL)1 (Taylor et al. 1991, 1994). More recent studies, using an assay with a limit of detection of 0.046 lg mL)1, determined the elimination half-life to be 6.6 hours after 2 mg kg)1 IV (Horii et al. 2004). The long half- life could be reduced if a drug was given to block active enterohepatic recirculation. Flunixin is act- ively transported into liver cells and then excreted into bile. Renal tubular secretion is a minor pathway of excretion. In a study in which \ufb02unixin 1 mg kg)1 PO was administered every 24 hours for 7 days, there was no accumulation of drug (Taylor et al. 1994). In fact, the maximal con- centration and the AUC0)24 were less on day 7 than on day 1, suggesting that the drug was eliminated more rapidly. Serum thromboxane concentrations were <75% of baseline up to 7 hours after giving \ufb02unixin on day 1, but for only 2 hours on day 7. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased from 11.4 to 21.3 IU L)1, sug- gesting that liver toxicity may be a problem with chronic administration. Label doses Flunixin is not approved for the cat. Evidence of ef\ufb01cacy There is only one study that has examined the effect of \ufb02unixin (1 mg kg)1 IV) in 40 cats undergoing a variety of surgical procedures. The study used three observers and a VAS, and found no signi\ufb01cant dif- ferences in analgesia between \ufb02unixin and meperi- dine, except at 15 minutes, when the cats given meperidine were in less pain. The cats given \ufb02unixin were less sedate from 30 to 90 minutes (Fonda 1996). Recommended off-label doses The recommended dose", "244": "is 0.5\u20131 mg kg)1 IV or PO, once. Ketoprofen Pharmacokinetics and COX selectivity Ketoprofen is a chiral molecule that has different pharmacokinetics for the two mirror-image, entan- tiomeric, R()) and S(+) forms. The drug is highly bioavailable in cats after oral dosing and similar pharmacokinetic differences were noted for the two enantiomers with IV and oral dosing of the racemic mixture (Lees et al. 2003). There are no published data on the relative inhibition of COX-1 or COX-2 by ketoprofen in the cat. Label doses Ketoprofen is not approved for the cat in the USA but in Europe, Australasia, and Canada, the labeled doses are: PO: 1 mg kg)1 daily for up to 5 days, and SC: 2 mg kg)1 daily for up to 3 days. Evidence of ef\ufb01cacy Administration of ketoprofen did not affect the wheal volume produced by intradermal caragee- nan injection, but skin wheal temperature was reduced in cats given 2 mg kg)1 IV at some time points during the 12 hours after treatment (Lees et al. 2003). In cats with clinical pyrexia above 39.3 \u0003C, randomly assigned to antibiotics or antibiotics plus ketoprofen (2 mg kg)1 SC once, followed by 1 mg kg)1 orally for 4 days) those given ketoprofen recovered faster from pyrexia, inappetance, and depression (3 days) than cats given antibiotics alone (5 days) (Glew et al. 1996). The antipyretic effect of ketoprofen was rapid and lasted for >8 but <24 hours. In a large study, Slingsby (1997) examined 100 cats undergoing \ufb02ank ovariohysterectomy, ran- domly assigned to meperidine, buprenorphine, ketoprofen, carprofen, or control groups. The dose of ketoprofen was 2 mg kg)1 SC, administered at extubation. Pain was assessed using a VAS. Until Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs in cats: A review BDX Lascelles et al. 238 \u0002 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation \u0002 2007", "245": "Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 34, 228\u2013250 1\u20132 hours after surgery the lowest pain scores were in the two opioid groups. Scores at 4 and 8 hours, and the next morning were lower in NSAID groups. Signi\ufb01cantly less rescue anal- gesia was administered to cats in NSAID groups (Slingsby 1997). In a study of 60 cats undergoing \ufb02ank ovariohysterectomy (Slingsby & Waterman- Pearson 1998), patients were randomly assigned to control, meperidine, buprenorphine, or ketopro- fen (2 mg kg)1 SC, given at extubation) groups. The single-observer VAS score for pain was lower for the ketoprofen group compared with the control group at 4, 8, and 18 hours, compared with the meperidine group at 2, 4, and 8 hours, and compared with the buprenorphine group at 8 hours. Overall clinical score and need for inter- vention was signi\ufb01cantly lower in the ketoprofen group compared with the control and both opioid groups (Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 1998). Ketoprofen was equally as effective as carprofen, meloxicam, and tolfenamic acid (see Carprofen above) (Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 2000). There is one reported study that assessed the effect of ketoprofen for 5 days on chronic pain (Lascelles et al. 2001). Both the cats that received meloxicam (n \u00bc 43; 0.3 mg kg)1 day 1 followed by 0.1 mg kg)1 daily) and those that received ketoprofen (n \u00bc 26; 1 mg kg)1 PO daily for 5 days) improved in demeanor, feed intake, weight bearing and lameness. Pain on palpation and in\ufb02ammation decreased but there was no control group and there were no signi\ufb01cant differences between groups (Lascelles et al. 2001). The doses used in this study were those used, clinically, in cats for chronic pain. Toxicity Inhibition of platelet COX-1, measured by ex vivo thromboxane synthesis in feline blood, lasted for 72 hours after administration of 2 mg kg)1 keto-", "246": "profen IV, and for 24 hours after 1 mg kg)1 orally (Lees et al. 2003). However, no excessive bleeding (from direct observation, with \u2018excessive\u2019 meaning any bleeding from the wound postoperatively) was noted in a study of 60 cats comparing meperidine, buprenorphine, and ketoprofen administered after ovariohysterectomy (Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 1998). Pages (2005) reported two cases of renal insuf\ufb01ciency following ketoprofen administration, but one cat had received a dose 15 times higher than that normally used. Recommended off-label doses After critical evaluation of the available published information, the authors recommend 1 mg kg)1 daily (PO or SC) for up to 5 days, or 2 mg kg)1 SC as a single injection. Meloxicam Pharmacokinetics and COX selectivity Meloxicam is nearly 100% bioavailable after SC injection to cats, with a Tmax of approximately 2.2 hours, and the terminal elimination half-life in cats is 15 hours after a single 0.3 mg kg)1 dose by this route. In vitro studies using stan- dardized whole blood assays demonstrated 43% inhibition of COX-1 and 90% inhibition of COX-2 at a plasma meloxicam concentration of 3.95 lM, which would be the maximum concen- tration achieved with the label dose. Any melo- xicam concentration producing COX-2 inhibition always caused at least 20% COX-1 inhibition as well. At plasma concentrations of meloxicam producing more than 80% inhibition of COX-2, a reasonable therapeutic target, COX-1 inhibition was >40%. If an IC50 of COX-2 was chosen as a therapeutic target, the extrapolated dose was 0.11 mg kg)1 every 24 hours. If an IC80 of COX-2 was chosen as a therapeutic target, the extrapo- lated dose was 0.17 mg kg)1 every 24 hours. For the label dose, the time above IC50 for COX-2 was 23 hours, while the time above IC80 was 8.8 hours. The time above IC10 for COX-1 was 109.5", "247": "hours, while the time above IC20 was 64 hours. If COX-1 inhibition, above a certain minimal amount, may result in GI side effects, then the label dose would be likely to cause toxi- city, if given more than once (Lees et al. 2004a; Giraudel et al. 2005). Label doses Meloxicam is approved (Europe, Australia, New Zealand, USA) at a dose of 0.3 mg kg)1 SC once, prior to surgery. There are currently no approved dosing schedules for repeated dosing, although chronic dosing recommendations for cats are available in the US Pharmacopoeia (http:// www.usp.org/pdf/EN/veterinary/meloxicam.pdf \u2013 accessed February 8, 2006) based primarily on the work of Lascelles et al. (2001). Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs in cats: A review BDX Lascelles et al. \u0002 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation \u0002 2007 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 34, 228\u2013250 239 Evidence of ef\ufb01cacy The effect of meloxicam on fever was studied in vivo, using a single intravenous dose of 0.1, 0.3, or 0.5 mg kg)1, given 30 minutes before endotoxin challenge (Justus & Quirke 1995). Body temperature was measured for 300 minutes after the adminis- tration of endotoxin and a dose-related prevention of fever was demonstrated. The degree of fever preven- tion gained by increasing the dose from 0.3 to 0.5 mg kg)1 was minimal, compared to that gained by increasing from 0.1 to 0.3 mg kg)1. This study is the justi\ufb01cation for the label dose of 0.3 mg kg)1, administered once (Justus & Quirke 1995). In another study (Engelhardt et al. 1996), cumulative intravenous doses of 4 mg kg)1 of meloxicam were administered to cats under IP chloralose-urethane anesthesia. Minimal effects on arterial blood pressure were noted. There was no effect on the blood \ufb02ow in the carotid artery, heart rate, ECG tracings, or respiratory minute volume (Engelhardt et al. 1996). Two studies have compared", "248": "meloxicam with carprofen and other NSAIDs (for results see Carpro- fen above) (Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 2000, 2002). Recently, a study was performed in which 64 female cats and 74 male cats were assigned to receive meloxicam (n \u00bc 72; 0.3 mg kg)1 SC) or butorpha- nol (n \u00bc 66; 0.4 mg kg)1 SC) prior to onychectomy (Carroll et al. 2005). There was no control group. Cats in the meloxicam group were less lame, had lower pain scores, and fewer required rescue anal- gesia, as assessed on palpation, a subjective gait score, and visual observation. Plasma cortisol concentra- tions were signi\ufb01cantly higher at extubation and lower at 3, 5, 12, and 24 hours after extubation in the meloxicam group. General impression scores were excellent or good for 75% of the cats in the meloxicam group and 44% of the cats in the butorphanol group. There was no difference in buccal mucosal bleeding time between the groups. Hematocrit and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), decrea- sed in both groups, while glucose decreased after surgery in the meloxicam group (Carroll et al. 2005). There is one reported study assessing the effect of meloxicam on chronic pain (see Ketoprofen for details) (Lascelles et al. 2001). Toxicity There are no published reports primarily evaluat- ing the clinical toxicity of meloxicam in cats. The manufacturer\u2019s package insert suggests the safety margin is narrow (http://www.bi-vetmedica. com/product_sites/METACAMINCats/documents/ Metacam_Inj_cats_label.pdf \u2013 accessed July 31, 2006), and this has also been suggested from work evaluating the pharmacokinetics and pharmacody- namics of COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition (Giraudel et al. 2005). As discussed above, in clinical studies primarily evaluating ef\ufb01cacy, clinical short-term toxicity has been evaluated following single doses of meloxicam. In a total of 40 cats adminis- tered meloxicam, BUN decreased and asparate aminotransferase increased 24 hours after surgery (Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 2002),", "249": "but there were no changes in creatinine or ALT. In a study of 138 cats administered a single dose of meloxicam, or butorphanol, there was no difference in buccal mucosal bleeding time between the groups; hemato- crit and BUN were decreased in both groups 24 hours after surgery, while glucose decreased after surgery in the meloxicam group (Carroll et al. 2005). Recommended off-label doses After critical evaluation of the available published information, the authors recommended 0.1\u2013 0.2 mg kg)1 PO or SC as a single dose for perioper- ative pain, followed by 0.05 mg kg)1 for 4 days. For chronic conditions, they recommended 0.1 mg kg)1 PO or SC on day 1, followed by 0.05 mg kg)1 for 1\u20134 days; then to reduce it rapidly to the lowest effective dose (0.025 mg kg)1 every 24 or 48 hours); monitoring closely for side effects. Phenylbutazone Pharmacokinetics and COX selectivity The clearance mechanism or pharmacokinetics of phenylbutazone in cats has not been reported. According to the US Pharmacopeia, phenylbutazone is rapidly converted to the active metabolite oxy- phenylbutazone, which is very slowly eliminated by the cat (http://www.usp.org/pdf/EN/veterinary/ phenylbutazone.pdf \u2013 accessed May 23, 2006). In all species evaluated to date, clearance of phenyl- butazone occurs primarily via metabolism in the liver and excretion of metabolites in urine and bile (Tobin et al. 1986; Mills et al. 1995). In humans, the majority of a phenylbutazone dose is cleared via glucuronidation (Dieterle et al. 1976; Aarbakke 1978). However, the role of glucuronidation in Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs in cats: A review BDX Lascelles et al. 240 \u0002 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation \u0002 2007 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 34, 228\u2013250 phenylbutazone clearance in other species is un- clear, although it may be substantial. There is no information on relative COX-1 or 2 inhibition in the cat.", "250": "Label doses Phenylbutazone was approved for use in the cat in the UK at a dose of 25 mg/cat, once or twice daily for 7 days, reducing to 25 mg/cat daily or every other day thereafter. The license has recently been withdrawn. Recently, the license in Australia for phenylbutazone use in cats was not renewed (1999). Evidence of ef\ufb01cacy No studies supporting the ef\ufb01cacy or safety of phenylbutazone use in cats have been published to date. Toxicity Phenylbutazone is approved by the FDA in the USA for anti-in\ufb02ammatory treatment of musculoskeletal disorders in horses and dogs. Although there is signi\ufb01cant extra-label use in other species, use in cats is limited by toxicity concerns, although pub- lished data on this are limited. In one experimental study all \ufb01ve cats treated with phenylbutazone at a dose of 44 mg kg)1 daily (about twice the dose used in dogs) showed anorexia within 3 days, and four of the cats died within 3 weeks, with the \ufb01fth being killed in extremis after 7 weeks (Carlisle et al. 1968). Toxicity primarily manifested as bone marrow suppression as well as GI, renal, and liver injury (Carlisle et al. 1968). Recommended off-label doses Given the current sparse information on phenyl- butazone, the authors cannot recommend its clini- cal use in cats at the present time. Piroxicam Pharmacokinetics and COX selectivity Single-dose pharmacokinetics for oral and intra- venous doses of 0.3 mg kg)1 have been deter- mined in the cat (Heeb et al. 2003). There are no reported pharmacodynamic studies, nor has the COX-1/COX-2 selectivity been determined for the cat. The median elimination half-life is 12 hours for the intravenous dose and 13 hours for the oral dose. This is shorter than in the dog, in which elimination half-lives of 37 and 40 hours have been measured (McKellar", "251": "et al. 1991). The Tmax following oral administration is 3 hours (Heeb et al. 2003). Multiple-dose pharmacokinetics and acute safety have been evaluated for piroxicam administered at 0.3 mg kg)1 daily for 10 days, with and without concurrent cimetidine administration (Heeb et al. 2005). The mean half-life increased from 11 hours on day 1 to 14 hours on day 10. Cimetidine reduced the half-life of piroxicam, but not signi\ufb01cantly (Heeb et al. 2005). Label doses Piroxicam is not approved for use in the cat. Evidence of ef\ufb01cacy There are no studies of its analgesic ef\ufb01cacy in the cat. Piroxicam has been used mainly in the treat- ment of epithelial neoplasia, although there appears to be little rationale for this treatment, as feline tumors have not been shown to over-express COX enzymes (Beam et al. 2003). Toxicity There is no information on the toxicity of piroxi- cam in the cat, but unpublished work by one of the authors (BDX Lascelles, personal communica- tion, 2006) suggests daily dosing can lead to a signi\ufb01cant decrease in hematocrit in 30% of cats after 7\u201314 days. In one study, serum BUN, creati- nine, alkaline phosphatase, and ALT all remained within their reference ranges. Four of seven cats receiving piroxicam developed mild to severe gas- tric erosions; however, they remained clinically asymptomatic. Two of seven cats receiving both piroxicam and cimetidine (15 mg kg)1 PO every 12 hours) developed mild erosions (Heeb et al. 2005). Recommended off-label doses Doses of 0.3 mg kg)1 PO every 24\u201348 hours have been used in the treatment of neoplasia but it is not known whether this dose provides anti-in\ufb02amma- tory or analgesic effects. Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs in cats: A review BDX Lascelles et al. \u0002 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation \u0002 2007 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 34, 228\u2013250 241 Tepoxalin", "252": "Pharmacokinetics and COX selectivity Tepoxalin is classi\ufb01ed as a dual inhibitor and has inhibitory activity against COX-1, COX-2, and 5-LOX in dogs (Agnello et al. 2005). There is no information about its selectivity or action in cats. Label doses Tepoxalin is not approved for use in the cat. Evidence of ef\ufb01cacy There is no published information on ef\ufb01cacy of tepoxalin in cats. Toxicity There is no information on safety or toxicity of tepoxalin in the cat. Recommended off-label doses There are currently no safety data for cats, and the optimal dose, dosing interval, and formulation have not been established. Tolfenamic acid Pharmacokinetics and COX selectivity There are no data available describing the pharmacokinetics for this drug in cats. In vitro assays using a canine monocyte/macrophage cell line show that it preferentially inhibits COX-2 over COX-1 (Kay-Mugford et al. 2000), but other authors suggested that it is a preferential COX-1 inhibitor (Vane & Botting 1995). Newly available feline-speci\ufb01c assays will provide a robust method for determining NSAID selectivity in this species, but tolfenamic acid has not been tested using this system (Giraudel et al. 2005). Label doses This drug belongs to the fenamate group of NSAIDs and is licensed for use in cats in many countries including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and most members of the European Union, but not the United States. It is the most popular NSAID used in France (Hugonnard et al. 2004). In cats, tolfenamic acid is labeled for oral and/or injectable use (for example: 4 mg kg)1 \u2013 product packet insert; Ve \u00b4toquinol Inc., Lavaltrie, Quebec, Canada) for 3\u2013 5 days, depending on the country of license, for the treatment of upper respiratory disease and as a symptomatic treatment of fever (product packet insert). Evidence of ef\ufb01cacy There are few published reports on the clinical use", "253": "of tolfenamic acid in cats. However, Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson (2000) compared it with other NSAIDs and found it to be equally as effective as carprofen, ketoprofen, and meloxicam (see Carpro- fen for details). Toxicity There is little information on the toxicity of tolfe- namic acid in the cat. In a study of 63 cats treated with a placebo (n \u00bc 32) or tolfenamic acid (n \u00bc 31) (4 mg kg)1) for 3 days, for fevers of various etio- logies, the incidence of side effects (seven cases in each group: vomiting, diarrhea, polyuria, poly- dypsia, and aggressiveness) was similar in both groups (Thomas et al. 1993). It is suggested that when the injectable formulation is used in cats undergoing general anesthesia, tolfenamic acid should not be administered until they are fully recovered (http://www.vetoquinol.co.uk \u2013 accessed July 21, 2006). However, it has been administered at endotracheal extubation without any untoward side effects (Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 2000). Recommended doses Recommended doses are the same as the label doses (4 mg kg)1 PO once daily, for 3 days; or, 4 mg kg)1 every 24 hours for a maximum of two doses). Vedaprofen Pharmacokinetics and COX selectivity Vedaprofen is an NSAID licensed in the Netherlands and the UK for use in the dog for the control of musculoskeletal pain. It has been described as a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, but there is no infor- Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs in cats: A review BDX Lascelles et al. 242 \u0002 2007 The Authors.

Label doses Vedaprofen is not approved for use in the cat. Evidence of ef\ufb01cacy Vedaprofen (0.5 mg kg)1) has been found to pro- vide analgesia following ovariohysterectomy in the cat (Horspool et", "254": "al. 2001). Cats were treated with oral vedaprofen gel (0.5 mg kg)1; n \u00bc 142) or placebo (n \u00bc 160), daily for 3 days, and behavior and appetite were assessed. Detailed information is lacking, but the authors indicated that the cats receiving vedaprofen returned to normal behavior and appetite more quickly than those treated with placebo. They indicated the incidence of side effects (unde\ufb01ned GI signs) were the same in each group, 7% and 5%, respectively (Horspool et al. 2001). Toxicity There is no published information on safety or toxicity of vedaprofen in the cat. Recommended off-label doses There are no safety data for cats at this time, and the optimal dose and dosing interval have not been established. Vedaprofen cannot yet be recommen- ded for use in the cat. The role of NSAIDS as anti-neoplastic agents There is growing evidence from experimental, epi- demiological, and clinical trials that NSAIDs and, in particular, the COX-2 selective drugs may have a role in prevention and treatment of some types of tumors (Thun et al. 2002). COX-2 has been iden- ti\ufb01ed in many human and dog carcinomas, and its upregulation and overexpression result in high concentrations of prostaglandins, most notably PGE2 (Mohammed et al. 2004). In dogs, COX-2 is expressed in many neoplasms (47\u2013100% of squamous cell carcinomas, trans- itional cell carcinomas, and prostatic adenocarcino- mas) (Khan et al. 2000; Kleiter et al. 2004; Mohammed et al. 2004). Strong COX-2 expression in appendicular osteosarcomas has been associated with a signi\ufb01cantly shorter survival time compared to dogs with no, or poor to moderate COX-2 expression in the tumor (Mullins et al. 2004). Beam et al. (2003) performed immunocytochemistry studies on a variety of feline neoplasms to determine COX-2 expression. In contrast to canine tumors, only 37% of feline transitional cell carcinomas and 9%", "255": "of oral squamous cell carcinomas expressed COX-2. No COX-2 immunoreactivity could be found in feline cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas (mammary, intestinal, and pul- monary), or vaccine-related sarcomas (Beam et al. 2003). The authors suggest that there is a species difference in COX-2 expression between canine and feline neoplasms, and that NSAIDs may have little application in the treatment of tumors in cats. Their work needs con\ufb01rmation, especially as the anti- bodies were not speci\ufb01c for the cat. As yet, there are no published studies of NSAID effectiveness as anticancer agents in the cat. Owner compliance Administration of medications to cats is a problem for some owners. There is only one study that has examined (as a secondary outcome measure) the ease of NSAID administration to cats, in which meloxicam drops were found to be easier to administer than ketoprofen tablets (Lascelles et al. 2001). Accurate dosing, using formulations de- signed for dogs or humans, can be a problem with drugs that are not approved and marketed for cats. A pill splitter or razor blade can be used to cut tablets, but split tablets do not always contain the intended dose (Teng et al. 2002). Alternatively, liquid formulations designed for injection have been administered as oral drops. There are no data showing that appropriate blood levels are achieved when cats are treated with NSAIDs in this fashion, but the high bioavailability of most NSAIDs suggests that this may be a reasonable strategy. The taste preferences of cats are understood (Thombre 2004) and compounding pharmacies will create \ufb02avored liquids and pastes for cats; however, the stability of the product in these formulations is unknown. There is a great deal of interest in developing methods for transdermal administration of NSAIDS, but the precise formulation and design of the transdermal patch or gel", "256": "appears critical in achieving reliable absorption of the drug (Takahashi et al. 2002; Swart et al. 2005). Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs in cats: A review BDX Lascelles et al. \u0002 2007 The Authors. Journal compilation \u0002 2007 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 34, 228\u2013250 243 Responsible use of NSAIDS in cats Responsible use of NSAIDs includes administering products that are licensed for use in cats and for the labeled indications where possible, because this means that there exists a body of evidence-based medicine to support this use. The reader should be aware that licensing varies widely between coun- tries. If NSAIDs are used off-label the owner should be made aware of this fact. In all cases, they should be informed of the possible side effects in their pet both verbally and in writing. This should include what clinical signs to look for (e.g., vomiting, in- appetance, bloody stool) that would warrant calling their veterinarian and stopping treatment. Acute and perioperative use Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs are effective in cats for the alleviation of surgical pain and for the treatment of upper respiratory diseases and fever. Carprofen and meloxicam are labeled for preopera- tive use but should not be used if there is pre- existing hypovolemia, dehydration, or hypotension. If substantial blood loss is predicted, their use should be reserved for the postoperative period when \ufb02uid replacement has been adequate and normal car- diovascular and circulatory function is restored. Because ketoprofen has been shown to affect platelet function ex vivo in cat blood (Lees et al. 2003), it is recommended that its use is reserved for the post- operative period. The authors highly recommend administering perioperative \ufb02uids to cats when using NSAIDs for the relief of perioperative pain. NSAIDs should not be used in combination with corticosteroids because both act on the arachidonic acid", "257": "pathway; their use together increases the risk of adverse side effects, especially in the GI tract. Pre-administration hematological examination may detect animals unsuitable for NSAID treatment (e.g., those with renal disease or signi\ufb01cant liver disease) and provide an historical baseline if there is an unexpected complication following administra- tion. Preoperative blood work should include meas- urement of BUN and creatinine. A baseline hematocrit and total plasma protein should also be recorded. Although it is usually stated that animals with hepatic disease should not receive NSAIDs, this is more controversial than the more clear-cut issue of renal disease. Hepatic function is not re\ufb02ected by measuring hepatic enzymes. If hepatic disease is suspected, liver function tests such as measurement of fasting serum bile acids should be undertaken before a decision is made to use an NSAID. Repeat dosing of NSAIDs should be undertaken with particular care in cats, because of the variable and sometimes long half-lives (e.g., carprofen 20.1 \u00b1 16.6 hours). Subsequent treatments should be administered at a reduced dose or increased dosing interval. For the majority of drugs, there is little evidence to guide dosing recommendations. Tolfenamic acid or ketoprofen can be used for several days where appropriate licensing is present, but even then the labeled indication does not include postoperative pain. There is little information on appropriate washout periods between different NSAIDs in dogs, and none in the cat. It is therefore recommended that any treatment using NSAIDs is completed using the same drug as used initially. If further doses of that drug are considered inappropriate, other treatment options that do not include NSAIDs should be considered. Chronic administration Tolfenamic acid and ketoprofen are labeled for up to 5 days\u2019 use in some countries, but unlike dogs, no NSAIDs are intended for long-term use in cats. De- spite this,", "258": "many cats have bene\ufb01ted from treatment with NSAIDs for months and sometimes years. The most commonly used drug for this purpose is oral meloxicam (authors\u2019 personal experience) although this is off-label use of the product. In our opinion it is important to reduce the dose to the lowest level that produces the desired result. For example, in cats with degenerative joint disease, suf\ufb01cient comfort may be achieved with as little as 0.025 mg kg)1 every other or every third day. There are no established guidelines for type or fre- quency of testing that should be performed in cats receiving long-term therapy. However, a thorough physical examination should be performed and a complete blood count and chemistry panel (at least BUN, creatinine, total plasma proteins, albumin, liver enzymes, and electrolytes) evaluated prior to a course of any NSAID. Elevations in BUN and cre- atinine occur relatively late in renal disease, there- fore screening urine for protein has been recommended as this can detect disease earlier. Several tests including urine dipsticks, microalbu- minuria assays, and sulfosalicylic acid precipitation tests are available. Any positive test should be fol- lowed by measurement of urine protein:creatinine Nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs in cats: A review BDX Lascelles et al. 244 \u0002 2007 The Authors.

Baseline evaluation should be repeated 1 week after the start of treat- ment. The implications of increased liver enzymes at any point before or during treatment are dif\ufb01cult to determine. A moderate increase may be expected with any chronic drug administration, and, as pre- viously stated, liver enzymes are not a good meas- ure of hepatic function. If there are concerns about hepatic function, liver function tests should be conducted. Suggested intervals for repeating blood work and", "259": "urine analysis are arbitrary. However, every 1\u20132 months is suggested for cats, as many of these are likely to be older and in an age range where chronic renal failure is most likely to occur. Early detection of problems will allow quicker intervention, and hopefully resolution, or at least stabilization of the patient. In some cases, after discussion with the owner, it may be decided that the bene\ufb01ts to the cat\u2019s welfare of continuing ther- apy with NSAIDs outweigh the potential risks and this reinforces the importance of communication with owners and the value of informed consent.

PROFILE Definitions \u25cfPain is an aversive sensory experience that causes response with protective motor actions, resulting in learned avoid- ance of the experience.1 In addition to the sensory experience, there is an affective/emotional compo- nent.2 \u25cfAdaptive pain, which is defined as an appropriate hypersensitive response to a potentially damag- ing stimulus, is respon- sive to medication.3 \u25cfMaladaptive pain (commonly referred to as wind-up pain), defined as sponta- neous hypersensi- tivity resulting from abnormal processing of a stimulus by the central nervous system (CNS), does not respond to treatment.3 \u25cfAllodynia is pain caused by a stimulus that does not normally provoke pain, according to the International Association for the Study of Pain.4 Allodynia can be a component of mal- adaptive pain.2 \u25cfIn cats, assessment of pain sensation cannot C O N T I N U E S FIND MORE Go to page 24 to see Determining Pain Scores in Cats or download it at cliniciansbrief.com. Chronic Pain Signs of chronic pain in cats may be markedly different from those seen in dogs. Cats that demonstrate aggression or have pain that does not respond to opioids or NSAIDs may have maladaptive pain. \u25cfChanges in behavior\u2014less social with owners, aggression toward members of the household, urinating outside litter box \u25cfDecreased appetite, weight loss, and disinter- est in normal activities; however, these signs have many causes11 \u25cfSigns of chronic pain attributed to \u201cnormal aging\u201d include increased sleeping; decreased jumping, climbing, or overall activity; and reluctance to be petted10 DIAGNOSIS \u25cfDiagnosing the cause of pain is important to its elimination or, at least, to its control. Repeated examinations are vital to anticipate changes needed in pain management (Figures 2 and 3). \u25cfPain management may need to change with progressive diseases (eg, osteoarthritis, cancer, intervertebral disk disease) or in hospice patients.2 \u25cfOwners", "275": "should learn the signs of pain in cats and how these differ from signs in dogs. In some cases, clinic visits for repeat examina- tions to assess effectiveness of pain manage- ment stress the cat extensively; the owner\u2019s assessment of the cat\u2019s comfort level may be employed in those cases. TREATMENT Precautions Compared with other species, cats have fewer hepatic phase II enzymes (such as uridine 5- diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase); therefore, they cannot metabolize drugs that are excreted as glucuronide conjugates.8 Consequently, some dosages and dosing intervals may be very differ- Pa t i e n t S u p p o r t C O N T I N U E D 20..................................................................................................................................................................NAVC Clinician\u2019s Brief / September 2010 / Patient Support Cats in acute pain hold their heads down and squint their eyes, or they may hide their heads. When in a crate or cage, they often have hunched backs and do not move around or respond to humans. 1 \u25cfCauses of chronic pain are varied but may include degenerative joint disease, dental and gum disease, neoplasia, interstitial cystitis, dermatitis, and chronic wounds.8 \u25cfRisks for acute or chronic pain vary according to cause of the pain stimulus, but the risk for chronic pain increases with age. \u25cfRisk for maladaptive pain increases when adaptive pain is not appropriately managed. Pathophysiology \u25cfMaladaptive pain develops when adaptive pain is untreated for a prolonged period, resulting in sensitization of dorsal horn neu- rons. Maladaptive pain may be present with or following resolution of adaptive pain. \u25cfAs the threshold for pain sensation is low- ered, wind-up pain develops in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Pain wind-up can worsen acute pain and cause chronic maladaptive pain. \u25cfNociceptors throughout the body can convert a chemical, thermal, or mechanical stimulus into an electrical impulse through a process", "276": "termed transduction. This impulse is transmit- ted from the periphery to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, then the brain and thalamus, and finally the cerebral cortex.9 Signs Acute Pain \u25cfHiding or holding head down, squinting the eyes (Figure 1) \u25cfLicking or biting the surgical site \u25cfHunched back, resisting movement \u25cfIgnoring attempts by humans to interact \u25cfNot urinating (even with a full bladder), eat- ing, or drinking8,10 ent in cats compared to dogs. For example, drugs such as acetaminophen (paracetamol) are toxic to cats. Several NSAIDs are also very slowly metab- olized and should be avoided. Analgesia Strategies Perioperative Analgesia Opioids may reduce anesthetic requirements in patients undergoing elective surgery. Local anesthetics and perioperative NSAIDs not only prevent acute pain but also decrease the risk for maladaptive pain.2 However, clinicians must account for risks associated with preexisting conditions, such as liver disease, renal disease, gastrointestinal disorders, blood clotting abnor- malities, and drug hypersensitivities. Postoperative Analgesia For many procedures, pain continues beyond the first 12 to 24 hours. Abrupt cessation of analgesia can result in maladaptive pain and delayed heal- ing and recovery from surgery. After the patient is stable and can eat/drink following surgery, pain management should be modified to a regimen that can be continued by the owner. This allows the practitioner to assess the efficacy of the anal- gesic protocol and make adjustments as necessary before sending the patient home. Chronic Pain Analgesia \u25cfNSAIDs, such as meloxicam, can control chronic pain and improve quality of life for many cats. \u25cfAncedotal reports suggest that the NMDA antagonist amantadine may also be useful for treating chronic and maladaptive pain. \u25cfGabapentin, which inhibits not only neuro- pathic pain but also pain associated with inflammation,12 has been used with some suc- cess in cats with lumbar nerve root entrapment due to", "277": "fractures or degenerative disk changes. I have also had success using it (3 mg/kg PO Q 12 H) to relieve pain associated with feline osteoarthritis. \u25cfAmitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, may offer another mode of treatment for chronic pain associated with osteoarthritis and inflam- matory bowel disease. MEDICATIONS Opioids Due to genetic variability of opioid receptors, one opioid may work well as an analgesic in one cat but not in another.8,13,14 Following declaw sur- gery, an opioid (such as buprenorphine) may be more effective than an NSAID. \u25cfHydromorphone: Shown to cause nausea and vomiting in cats, especially when administered subcutaneously.15 Has been associated with elevated body temperature up to 108.5\u00b0 F at doses of 0.1 mg/kg; lower intravenous doses (0.025\u20130.05 mg/kg) do not produce such increases but may not provide sufficient pain relief.8 Morphine is not frequently used in cats because it also causes vomiting and has a slow onset of action.8,16 \u25cfOxymorphone: Provides excellent analgesic effects that may be enhanced by addition of acepromazine.17 Hyperthermia is not commonly encountered at low doses.

Reported to be effective for pain related to interstitial cystitis; however, its ceiling effect prevents dose increases from producing greater analgesia.14 Butorphanol\u2019s duration of action is less than 90 minutes when given intravenously. Oral administration is possible, but the tablet may be difficult to administer; there are also no published data on the bioavailability of butorphanol follow- ing oral administration in cats.8 \u25cfBuprenorphine: Available as a liquid that is absorbed by transmucosal uptake; has excel- lent bioavailability. Analgesia can last 6 hours regardless of the route of administration. \u25cfFentanyl transdermal patches: Used in cats; however, the plasma concentrations achieved are variable; some may never achieve an analgesic concentration.18 Cats must be monitored closely for signs that pain is adequately controlled. \u25cfTramadol: Oral tramadol (10 mg/kg) was shown to lower minimum alveolar concentra- tion (MAC) of sevoflurane in cats if given 5 minutes before induction; however, some cats vomited or hypersalivated following adminis- tration of this high dose.19 Further investiga- tion is needed before it can be recommended. Oral tramadol is bitter and can be difficult to administer. NSAIDs For soft-tissue surgery (eg, ovariohysterectomy), an NSAID, such as meloxicam or ketoprofen, may provide adequate analgesia.8,20 NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes 1 and 2 with variable effects on gastric mucosal integrity, platelet function, and renal autoregula- tion. Because many are metabolized by glu- curonidation in the liver (except for meloxicam, which undergoes oxidation), frequent dosing may cause drug accumulation and toxicity.8", "279": "Long-term meloxicam use for chronic pain in cats is not approved by the FDA (only a single dose is approved); however, long-term use at the lowest possible dose can provide improved com- fort in cats. I monitor renal function, hepatic enzyme levels, and packed cell volume monthly to detect early signs of toxicity. If gastrointestinal erosions are suspected (due to decreases in packed cell volume and diminished liver or renal function), discontinuation of therapy is recom- mended. \u25cfCarprofen: Has a highly variable half-life of anywhere from 9 to 49 hours depending on the individual cat; it is not recomended.21,22 However, it has been approved for use in other countries and may be effective when administered as a single dose. \u25cfMeloxicam: A COX-2 selective NSAID that may be used for postoperative pain or chronic pain. In my experience, meloxicam combined with buprenorphine can provide adequate postoperative analgesia, and most owners are able to administer these medications at home. Studies have shown that as many as 18% of cats can develop gastrointestinal upset while receiving meloxicam, but generally these effects are not sufficiently severe to require withdrawal of the medication.23,24 Low-dose oral meloxicam has been shown to be effective for osteoarthritis pain in 85% of cases.8,25 Cats had no signs of renal side effects after 5 months of continuous use, although 4% did develop gastrointestinal upset.25 In cats with normal serum biochemical profiles, I use an induction dose of 0.1 mg/kg, then 0.1 mg per cat Q 24 H thereafter while monitoring blood analysis monthly. NMDA Antagonists \u25cfKetamine: Most widely recognized NMDA antagonist. Has analgesic properties that specifically inhibit central sensitization, or wind-up pain, and maladaptive pain. Low-dose infusions of ketamine produce analgesia; however, it can cause significant hyperalgesia in cats that are not experiencing painful stimuli.26 Since effects of ketamine in", "280": "cats have not been clearly defined, its use in clinical settings may not be warranted postop- eratively, but it may be used as a component of anesthesia induction protocol. \u25cfAmantadine: Has been reported to successfully control chronic pain in cats and may be better suited for maladaptive chronic pain than other COMPLICATIONS Long-term use of any analgesic requires careful monitoring because agents used may not remain effective as the disease being treated progresses. Gastrointestinal upset, renal disease, liver disease, and other complications may develop over time and require drug doses or dosing intervals to be adjusted accordingly. Occasionally, drugs may have to be discontinued. FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS In the future, more options will become available to veterinarians for the treatment of pain in cats; however, these drugs must be adequately investi- gated for safety and efficacy before they can be recommended for widespread use. Until then, recognizing pain in cats is the first challenge to overcome, followed by adequately treating that pain.

Side effects that can occur with lower doses include anxiety, restlessness, and dry mouth. Amanta- dine has been used with NSAIDs in dogs to treat pain associated with osteoarthritis and osteosarcoma; there are anecdotal reports of its successful use in cats with similar conditions.8,12 Gabapentin Gabapentin\u2019s mechanism of action is unknown, but it has been used adjunctively to treat neuropathic and inflammation-associated pain in humans. It has also been used in combination with an NSAID to manage osteoarthritis in dogs12 and has been successfully used alone in cats for pain associated with lumbar nerve root entrapment from fractures or degenerative disk disease.28 Because gabapentin is excreted in the urine, dosage and frequency must be adjusted for patients with renal insufficiency.28 I successfully treated a cat that had osteoarthritis- related pain and chronic liver disease with a combi- nation of gabapentin (3 mg/kg PO Q 12 H) and meloxicam (0.1 mg PO Q 4 days). Tricyclic Antidepressants Pain associated with interstitial cystitis has been successfully treated with amitriptyline, but some cats may have subsidence of clinical signs within several days even when no treatment is administered. Amitriptyline may have some benefit in the treatment of chronic pain from osteoarthritis or inflammatory bowel disease, but more research is needed to assess its efficacy for these conditions.8 FOLLOW-UP Patient Monitoring Cats receiving chronic analgesic therapy should have physical examinations, complete blood counts, urinalyses,", "282": "and serum biochemical pro- files performed once monthly or more frequently if they have concurrent chronic illnesses, such as renal or liver disease. Treatment of the underly- ing condition is always the foremost concern, and response to that treatment ultimately determines the prognosis.

C ats are now one of the most popular pets; in the UK alone, the population was 7.2 million in 2008.1 Most pet cats are neutered, hence, even without any other treatment, millions of cats un- dergo at least one surgical procedure. Unfortunately, cats still receive less treatment for perioperative pain compared with dogs, even after similar surgery.2e8 Recently the need for analgesia in cats has become better acknowledged, and many clinical and research studies have been undertaken to address the de\ufb01ciency. These have been reviewed in the last few years.9e11 Mu (OP3) opioid receptor agonists are generally ac- cepted as providing the best analgesia, and morphine is still regarded as the gold standard analgesic.12 Myths about morphine-induced mania in cats have prevented wide use of morphine in this species, in spite of clear demonstration that, at doses used clini- cally in other species, morphine is both effective and does not cause mania.13 However, in at least dogs and man, some of morphine\u2019s analgesic effect is due to production of morphine metabolites, particularly morphine 6 glucuronide14 and, as cats appear to have limited ability to produce such metabolites15, this may result in less effective morphine analgesia in this species. In addition, morphine frequently *Corresponding author.

Buprenorphine, usually regarded as a partial mu (OP3) agonist opioid,17 was originally developed in the 1970s for treatment of drug addicts as well as for analgesia.18 It was \ufb01rst investigated in veterinary pa- tients in the 1980s in a study of postoperative analge- sia in dogs.19 Buprenorphine has since become the most popular opioid used in small animal practice in Great Britain4 and is also widely used in the rest of Europe, Australia and South Africa.3,5 It now holds market authorisation for dogs and cats in Great Brit- ain and it has been widely used in these and many other species for decades.20 In laboratory animals bu- prenorphine has been shown to have a \u2018bell shaped\u2019 doseeresponse curve21 indicating that higher doses decrease the analgesic effect. This has led to label re- strictions on the dose and dosing interval, but serious clinical relevance has never been demonstrated.9 Butorphanol is a kappa-opioid (OP2) receptor ago- nist that has held market authorisation for analgesia in cats for a number of years. It is also commonly used in combination with a2 agents and ketamine for anaesthesia in this species,22 but there are no pub- lished data reporting analgesic performance of the tri- ple combination. Although butorphanol has been used for many years, its analgesic effect for many clinical procedures has often been challenged.23e25 Laboratory investiga- tions suggest that buprenorphine may provide better and longer lasting analgesia; for example, a much lon- ger duration of", "285": "thermal antinociception was reported after intramuscular (IM) buprenorphine (up to 12 h) compared with morphine (up to 6 h) and butorphanol (up to 30 min).16 Lascelles and Robertson26 reported 1e2 h thermal antinociception after 0.1e0.4 mg/kg bu- torphanol. Mechanical antinociception was also only of 90 min duration.27 Visceral analgesia (0.1 mg/kg IV or 0.4 SC) lasted 5e6 h in a model producing pain by in\ufb02a- tion of a rectal balloon.28 In contrast, one investigation differs from the rest and reported butorphanol-induced thermal antinociception of 8 h, longer than that pro- duced by buprenorphine.29 There have been numerous clinical studies investi- gating postoperative analgesia induced by either bu- prenorphine or butorphanol, but no comparisons between them. Three early investigations reported that buprenorphine produced better analgesia than morphine30 oxymorphone31 and pethidine.32 More re- cent studies have demonstrated that buprenorphine, al- though providing analgesia, did not perform as well as non-steroidal anti in\ufb02ammatory drugs (NSAIDs).33,34 Most clinical studies of butorphanol indicate postoper- ative pain relief of a few hours duration.35e38 Those re- porting longer periods included repeat dosing.39e41 As with buprenorphine, NSAIDs provided better postop- erative analgesia than butorphanol.38,42 The aim of this investigation was to compare the ef- fects of buprenorphine and butorphanol in providing postoperative analgesia in cats after routine surgery in general practice. A secondary aim was to examine the effect of any higher and repeated doses of buprenor- phine to elucidate the clinical relevance of the bell shaped doseeresponse curve. The study was con- ducted under ATC number 00117/2004. Some of the data were presented at the spring conference of the Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists in 2006.43 Materials and methods Animals Domestic cats admitted for surgery at seven veteri- nary practices in the UK were enrolled. Informed con- sent was obtained prior to entry of the cat into the", "286": "trial. At admission, the cats were randomly allocated to receive buprenorphine (Vetergesic; Alstoe Animal Health) or butorphanol (Torbugesic; Fort Dodge Ani- mal Health) at label or proposed label doses. Drinking water was available ad libitum prior to premedication and after recovery from anaesthesia. Food was with- held for at least 6 h prior to surgery. All cats under- went a full clinical examination to ascertain their health status. Biochemistry and haematology were un- dertaken only if the clinical examination indicated an abnormality that required further investigation. No cats were excluded on grounds of health. Premedication and anaesthesia Cats were premedicated according to normal practice routine with acepromazine (aim 10e50 mg/kg) IM with or without atropine (0.01e0.1 mg/kg) and either buprenorphine (aim 10e20 mg/kg IM) or butorphanol (aim 0.4 mg/kg IM) approximately 60 min prior to in- duction of anaesthesia. No other analgesics were given. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol, Saffan (Schering Plough Animal Health) or thiopentone given intravenously (IV) to effect. Where the expected duration of anaesthesia was more than a few minutes the cat\u2019s trachea was intubated and anaesthesia was maintained with iso\ufb02urane or halothane in oxygen, with or without nitrous oxide, using an appropriate breathing system. Routine physiological monitoring, always including heart and respiratory rate, took place during anaesthesia and in the immediate post- operative period. Where equipment was available pulse oximetry and indirect arterial blood pressure measurement using a Doppler signal were under- taken. The return of signal on slow release of the cuff pressure was taken as mean arterial pressure (MABP).44 Standard antibiotic and intravenous glu- cose and electrolyte solutions were given during anaesthesia as required by the individual patient. Assessment of pain and sedation Pre- and postoperative pain and sedation were as- sessed by an individual who did not know which 248 PM Taylor et", "287": "al opioid had been administered. Assessment was car- ried out using a four point simple descriptive scale (SDS) based on a previous study45 (see Table 1). Pain was assessed before anaesthesia, and both pain and sedation were assessed at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 20e24 h after the end of anaesthesia (when maintenance agent switched off). All assessments for a single cat were carried out by one trained individual, but there were one or two assessors at each clinic. During the assessment period, repeat administra- tion of the same dose of the same analgesic was given if required, followed by rescue analgesia with carpro- fen 4.0 mg/kg subcutaneously (SC) if the repeat dosing did not alleviate the pain. Statistical analysis Power calculations were based on best estimates from experience of use of the two opioids in cats. Using pain scores at the 2-h time point as the primary vari- able, with an expected distribution of 0 pain score 55:45 (buprenorphine: butorphanol), at 80% power, 160 cats per group (320 total) were proposed, allowing 10% withdrawal. The data were analysed by techniques suited to para- metric and non-parametric data as appropriate. Stu- dent\u2019s t test was used to compare single numerical normally distributed data such as body weight. Non- parametric data such as type of surgery were compared using the c2 test. Numerical data collected over time, such as pulse and respiratory rates, were compared us- ing two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s test when a signi\ufb01cant difference was de- tected. Summary overall comparison of all postopera- tive pain and sedation scores from each group (comprising \ufb01ve scores for each cat \u0002 number of cats in thegroup)were compared usingthe ManneWhitney test.

P < 0.05 was considered signi\ufb01cant. Numerical data are presented as mean \u0003 SD unless otherwise stated. Results Interim analysis of the pain assessment data after 156 cats had been enrolled indicated a signi\ufb01cant differ- ence between the groups; hence, data collection was stopped before the planned 160 per group had been included. Post induction data were not collected from three of the 156 cats as one proved too aggressive to allow any assessments, and two others became ag- gressive after premedication (butorphanol group). Hence 153 cats were studied, 83 given buprenorphine and 70 given butorphanol. There were no differences between the groups with respect to age, sex, body weight, breed or type and duration of surgery (Table 2). Most cats were domestic shorthairs undergoing neutering, but a number of other procedures was also included (Table 3). All cats received acepromazine (54e56 mg/kg) as part of the premedication, and atropine was also given to 17 cats in the buprenorphine group and 14 in the butorphanol group. The mean dose of bupre- norphine was 13 mg/kg, but doses ranged between 8 and 21 mg/kg. Eighteen cats received more than 18 mg/kg. The mean dose of butorphanol was 0.4 mg/kg, although doses ranged between 0.31 and 0.57 mg/kg. Most cats received propofol and iso\ufb02ur- ane, but Saffan, thiopentone and halothane were also used in both groups. There were no signi\ufb01cant differ- ences between the groups in the dose or identity of the anaesthetics used (Table 4). No attempt was made to assess the degree of sedation provided before anaes- thesia. However, a number of comments were re- corded describing the good quality of sedation in both groups at the time of induction. Two cats became aggressive in the butorphanol group, leading to a dif- \ufb01cult", "289": "induction.

The time elapsed between administration of premedication and the end of anaesthesia (time 0) was 95 \u0003 62 and 87 \u0003 41 min after buprenorphine and butorphanol respectively (P > 0.05). Heart rate before anaesthesia was 166 \u0003 32 beats per min (bpm) after buprenorphine and 163 \u0003 37 bpm after butorphanol. During anaesthesia, the rate ranged from 158 \u0003 33 and 149 \u0003 33 bpm 5 min after induction to 153 \u0003 33 and 146 \u0003 29 bpm at 15 min in the buprenor- phine and butorphanol groups, respectively. Respira- tory rate before anaesthesia was 44 \u0003 16 breaths per min after buprenorphine and 46 \u0003 15 per min after bu- torphanol. During anaesthesia it remained at 26 \u0003 10 breaths per min in the buprenorphine group and ranged from 25 \u0003 9 per min 5 min after induction to 23 \u0003 7 per min", "290": "at 15 min in the butorphanol group. There were no signi\ufb01cant differences between the groups in heart or respiratory rates during anaesthesia and there were no reports of apnoea or bradycardia. After anaesthesia, heart and respiratory rates re- mainedwithin normal limits, and nolifethreateningcar- diovascular or respiratory events occurred. Heart rate was higher than before anaesthesia in both groups, reaching a maximum at 30 min after anaesthesia of 180 \u0003 32 bpm after buprenorphine and 173 \u0003 41 bpm af- ter butorphanol. At 2 h heart rate was higher (172 \u0003 25 bpm) in the buprenorphine group compared with the butorphanol group (162 \u0003 28 bpm) (P \u00bc 0.0362). Respiratory rate was lower than before an- aesthesia in both groups, ranging from 30 \u0003 9 and 32 \u0003 9 breaths per min at 15 min to 34 \u0003 12 and 35 \u0003 17 breaths per min at 4 h in the buprenorphine and butorphanol groups, respectively. Respiratory rate was lower after buprenorphine than after butorphanol at 1 h (31 \u0003 8 vs 35 \u0003 12 breaths per min, P \u00bc 0.0301) and 2 h (31 \u0003 9 vs 36 \u0003 13 breaths per min, P \u00bc 0.0129). Pulse oximetry was carried out in 37 cats in the bu- prenorphine group and 32 in the butorphanol group. Oxygen haemoglobin saturation (SpO2) was generally above 95%; only one cat, after buprenorphine, had a transient reading below 90% (89%) when breathing air. Indirect blood pressure monitoring was under- taken in 16 cats in the buprenorphine group and 11 in the butorphanol group. MABP ranged between 87 \u0003 16 and 85 \u0003 16 mm Hg immediately after induc- tion to 94 \u0003 20 and 88 \u0003 22 mm Hg at 30 min in the bu- prenorphine and butorphanol groups, respectively.

By 4 h after sur- gery, only one cat, after butorphanol, was still moder- ately sedated, and around 80% were fully conscious. Preoperative pain scores in each group were not sig- ni\ufb01cantly different. Postoperatively, overall pain scores were signi\ufb01cantly lower after buprenorphine than after butorphanol (ManneWhitney test; P \u00bc 0.0465). At indi- vidual time points, the difference between the groups was signi\ufb01cant at 2 h (c2", "292": "test; P \u00bc 0.040) and 24 h (c2 test; P \u00bc 0.036) after surgery (Fig 1). At all post surgical time points there were more cats in the buprenorphine with pain score 0 and more in the butorphanol group with pain score 3. Further analgesia with either buprenorphine or bu- torphanol was required in 15% of the cats: 11 cats after buprenorphine and 12 after butorphanol (P > 0.05). Repeat analgesia was required 6.4 \u0003 6.3 (1e24) h after surgery in the buprenorphine group and 5.6 \u0003 5.3 (1e14) h after surgery in the butorphanol group (P > 0.05). The original dose of buprenorphine given to cats that required further analgesia was 0.013 \u0003 0.004 (0.009e0.019) mg/kg. The time at which further analgesia was required was not related to the original dose given. Rescue analgesia with carprofen was required in only two cats, both in the butorphanol group, at 2 and 24 h after surgery. Discussion All the cats in the study were client-owned and highly representative of the normal pet cat population. They were typical of those normally admitted to general veterinary practice clinics for surgery in that the ma- jority were young domestic shorthair cats undergoing neutering. However, a wide age range and some ped- igree animals were also included, and a variety of other common types of surgery was undertaken in both treatment groups. Anaesthetic and perioperative management was ac- cording to the normal practice in each clinic. Hence, a fair selection of anaesthetic protocols commonly used in feline practice were represented. Any drug with anal- gesic properties, such as the a2 adrenoceptor agonists, ketamine and any NSAID, was excluded so that the an- algesic effects of the two opioids were not confounded by the co-administration of other classes of analgesics. Pain assessment scales in cats have", "293": "not yet been val- idated as in dogs, and a variety of systems have been used historically in clinical studies. Visual analogue scales (VAS) are arguably the most powerful tool, not least because parametric statistical analysis can be used. However, in a multi-centre study with sev- eral assessors, VAS scoring is inappropriate; it has been shown that variability among observers ac- counted for 32e36% of the total variability with VAS, but that agreement was fair if a SDS was used.46 The SDS used in this study was able to detect a difference between the analgesic effects of buprenor- phine and butorphanol in spite of the potential limita- tions of this scoring system. The study demonstrated that IM buprenorphine (8e21 mg/kg) provided better analgesia than butor- phanol (0.31e0.57 mg/kg) in the postoperative pe- riod. Although no placebo group was included that would demonstrate the extent of analgesia produced by either agent, buprenorphine produced pain relief over and above that of butorphanol, producing more pain free cats (score 0) and fewer maximum pain scores (score 3) than butorphanol. The signi\ufb01cant dif- ference at 24 h suggests that buprenorphine also pro- vided pain relief of a considerably longer duration. These clinical data are consistent with laboratory reports where most investigations demonstrate that buprenorphine produces antinociception for many hours.16,47,48 There is no vomiting or dysphoria, and generally, cats become sedated, appearing happy and euphoric. In contrast, laboratory reports of butor- phanol antinociception, with one notable exception,29 describe short periods of antinociception; dysphoria is not uncommon26e28 but this was seen in only two cats in this study.

Unfortunately, there are few placebo con- trolled studies and many include other analgesics such as ketamine, well known for its pre-emptive an- algesic effect, making it dif\ufb01cult to assess the effect of the opioid.36,38,49 Most reports indicate a relatively short duration of effect of butorphanol, with the pe- riod of analgesia lengthened by repeated dosing.39e41 Clinical reports of buprenorphine suggest longer last- ing analgesia30 but this has not been rigorously exam- ined under clinical conditions. The need for rescue analgesia might elucidate the duration of analgesia under clinical conditions. However, this study did not show any difference between the groups in the Fig 1. Distribution of SDS pain scores in 153 cats before (pre-op) and after anaesthesia and surgery (1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h) following premedication with buprenorphine (n \u00bc 83) or butorphanol (n \u00bc 70). Overall scores", "295": "in the buprenorphine group were lower than in the butorphanol group (ManneWhitney U, P \u00bc 0.0465). Groups were signi\ufb01cantly different at 2 h (c2 test; P \u00bc 0.040) and 24 h (c2 test; P \u00bc 0.036). 252 PM Taylor et al need for rescue analgesia. This was given at the dis- cretion of the treating clinicians, when pain was con- sidered severe, generally at scores 2 and 3, and did not highlight any differences between scores of 0 and 1. Hence, although there were more cats in the buprenorphine group with a score of 0, compared with the butorphanol group where more had score 1, none of these were given rescue. The route of injection of buprenorphine appears in- \ufb02uential, particularly when lower doses are used. Stud- ies reporting that NSAIDs produced better pain relief than buprenorphine used either 10 mg/kg, the subcuta- neous (SC) route, or both.33,34 Smaller increases in thermal threshold have been reported after SC bupre- norphine compared with IV and transmucosal dos- ing.13,47 A buprenorphine patch maintained similar plasma concentrations to those reported after IV and buccal dosing, without the initial peak; however, ther- mal threshold did not increase.50 This result was con- sidered likely to arise from the hysteresis between plasma and effector site concentration. Presumably, ad- equate effector site concentration was not reached be- cause there was never a suf\ufb01cient concentration gradient to drive the drug to the effector site as would occur, for instance, after IV administration. The SC route is presumably intermediary betweentransdermal and IV in achieving a suf\ufb01cient concentration gradient, resulting in less analgesic effect than IV. One hour was allowed between premedication and induction of anaesthesia. This was within normal practice protocol, and allowed the full effects of ace- promazine to develop.51 As onset and duration of bu- torphanol appear", "296": "to be sooner and shorter than of buprenorphine16,26,47 this is likely to have in\ufb02uenced the postoperative analgesic effect. Repeat dosing of butorphanol may be more appropriate. The dose of buprenorphine has commonly been re- stricted as a result of early studies in laboratory ani- mals demonstrating a \u2018bell shaped\u2019 doseeresponse curve, where higher doses reduced the analgesic ef- fect.21 The doses in those reports were much higher than used in clinical pain treatment in dogs and cats, and there is no evidence that increasing the dose in cats several fold decreases the effect. Dose related increases in mechanical antinociception oc- curred when IV buprenorphine was increased from 10 to 40 mg/kg.52 Thermal antinociception did not in- crease with increasing doses between 10 and 80 mg/ kg, as many thresholds reached the safety cut off tem- perature,52,53 but increasing doses did not decrease thermal antinociception. Data from the present study are consistent with this. Doses of at least 20 mg/kg were used successfully, and were not associated with higher pain scores or the need for rescue analge- sia. Repeat analgesia with buprenorphine in the 11 cases which required it led to improved comfort, not a deterioration in pain relief. Overall data from a num- ber of other investigations of buprenorphine analgesia in cats30e34,54 suggest that doses greater than 10 mg/kg provide better analgesia than lower doses. An analgesic given preoperatively for postoperative analgesia may affect the course of anaesthesia. Opioids commonly reduce volatile anaesthetic requirements and are usually bene\ufb01cial in reducing the required dose of sedatives and injectable anaesthetics. They may however, exacerbate anaesthetic induced cardiopulmo- nary depression. Both buprenorphine and butorphanol have been widely used for premedication in cats and are suitable opioids for this purpose. Akkerdass et al55 considered buprenorphine and acepromazine to be bet- ter than midazolam/ketamine or", "297": "medetomidine prior to IV induction and iso\ufb02urane maintenance as cardiopul- monary characteristics were acceptable. Ilkiw et al56 and Pypendop57reported thatbothbutorphanol and bu- prenorphine reduced iso\ufb02urane MAC, but buprenor- phine\u2019s effect was less than after butorphanol or morphine. Physiological datacollected during anaesthe- sia and in the recovery period in the present study indi- cate that neither opioid had any deleterious effect on vital function and were safely used for premedication before general anaesthesia with a range of different an- aesthetic agents. Heart and respiratory rates, MABP and SpO2 were well within the normal range for cats un- dergoing anaesthesia and surgery, and there were never any moments where adequate cardiovascular and respi- ratory function were in question. Only one cat, which was breathing air, had an oxygen haemoglobin satura- tion reading of 89% after buprenorphine. This was tran- sient, and is only marginally below the accepted minimum of 90%. Anaesthesia will always cause some respiratory depression, and the decrease in respiratory rateseeninbothgroupswasnotunusual.Thereweremi- nor but statistically signi\ufb01cant differences between the two groups in both heart and respiratory rates postoper- atively. However, all values were well within the normal range and no signi\ufb01cant biological effect can be attrib- uted to this statistical difference. Neither opioid ap- peared to result in unacceptably slow recovery, as most cats were only mildly sedated 2 h after the end of anaesthesia. This investigation studied the effects of a single analgesic drug in order to elucidate their individual effects. However, although most cats were at least moderately comfortable, it is becoming widely ac- cepted that use of more than one type of analgesic, multimodal analgesia, probably provides better post- operative pain control. A combination of buprenor- phine and carprofen produced better pain relief after ovarohysterectomy in cats than either drug alone.58 It is also well recognised that there", "298": "is considerable in- dividual response to opioid analgesics in cats26,29,59 and each animal must be individually assessed to provide the best clinical pain management.

During the last", "304": "decade there has been a virtual ex- plosion in our knowledge of basic pain physiology (2,3), but the implications for clinical practice have been less substantial. The explanation for the discrep- ancy between the fast progress in basic pain patho- physiology and the rather slow advances in providing optimal postoperative pain treatment may be several, but one important factor may be that more than 95% o f the literature on postoperative pain treatment has con- sidered unimodal treatment. W e have emphasized previously that total or optimal pain relief allowing normal function can not be achieved by a single drug or method without major strain on equipment and surveillance systems or without significant side effects ( 4 ) . Therefore, we have recommended combined anal- gesic regimens (balanced analgesia) or a multimodal approach to the treatment of postoperative pain ( 4 ) . The rationale for this strategy is achievement of suffi- cient analgesia due to additive or synergistic effects between different analgesics, with concomitant reduc- tion of side effects, due to resulting lower doses of analgesics and differences in side-effect profiles. W e summarize here the existing knowledge con- cerning the efficacy of analgesic combination therapy from postoperative pain studies. The effects on post- operative outcome are not included, because of lack of sufficient studies. W e also exclude obstetric and pedi- atric pain, which may represent special pain entities and solutions for treatment, although they obviously share many of the problems of general postoperative pain.

Thus, single-dose combination therapy will not be dis- cussed unless vital to interpretation and to under- standing future approaches to prolonged combination therapy. We also did not review efficacy data from single modality treatments, because these have been reviewed elsewhere. Background Figure 1 shows the pathways o f nociceptive stimuli, including those conducting pain, from the site of sur- gical injury passing through the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system. At present, sev- eral techniques are available to treat pain: at the peripheral level using local anesthetics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID), opioids, or other an- algesics; peripheral nerve blocks with local anesthetics and a2-adrenergic agonists; at the spinal cord level us- ing local anesthetics, opioids, a2-agonists or other an- algesics; at the cortical level using opioids or other an- algesics; and, finally, a combination of these techniques. In the following, data on the efficacy and side effects of combination therapy, compared with unimodal therapy, are discussed with an emphasis on pain relief during function, such as cough and mobilization, rather than merely during rest. Peripheral-Acting Analgesics Local Anesthetics Local anesthetics have been used for several decades for wound infiltration, but their application and effi- cacy has been documented mostly in relatively minor or moderate procedures (5). The effect on postoperative pain is rather short-lasting, emphasizing the severe need for more long-acting drugs (5). There are few studies that evaluate the efficacy of combining other analgesic therapy with the administration of local anesthetics. This is unfortunate, because a combined peripheral attack on pain seems rational. 1048 Anesth Analg 1993;T71048-56 01993 by the International Anesthesia Research Society 0003-2999/93/$5.00 ANESTH ANALG 1993;77:1048-56 measures l o provlde portopernllve peln rellel REVIEW ARTICLE KEHLET AND DAHL 1049 BALANCED ANALGESIA - \"balanced analgesia\" \"multi-modal paln lherapv\"", "306": "central nsural blockade iepldural/lnlretliecal local aneslhellcs, oplolds. a,-agonlalrl TflAUMA anlegonlsm of endogenous algeslc subrtancea and of lnflan~melory response llocal eneithellcs, NSAID'a. oplolds. glucocorlicolds. 01CI Figure 1. Measures to provide pain relief. Peripheral Opioid Instillation Some clinical studies recently have demonstrated pe- ripheral instillation of morphine to reduce postarthro- scopic pain (6-10). The analgesic effect probably is mediated through inflammatory-induced novel ap- pearance of opioid receptors at the peripheral nerve endings (11). The efficacy of combining intraarticular local anesthetics and opioids may be important, but so far, the experience has been discordant (8,lO). Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs (NSAID) The value of NSAfDs in minor, moderate, or severe postoperative pain is well documented (12,131, but their efficacy is too small to be the sole analgesic in more severe pain states, although they represent an ideal alternative component in the multimodal ap- proach to postoperative pain treatment. Additive or synergistic effects of combining NSAID with systemic opioids are well documented in minor surgery (14-161, but most combination studies of NSAID and opioids have aimed to demonstrate the ability of additional NSAID to reduce the amount of opioid, resulting in a similar degree or only slightly improved pain relief (12,13). Although this approach may be valuable for minor procedures, such as laparoscopy, with subse- quent reduction of opioid-induced side effects (nausea, vomiting, sedation), a fixed-dose combination therapy theoretically should enhance the analgesic potency that is necessary in moderate or major surgery. So far, only one such study is available. It demonstrates improved analgesia by fixed-dose combination with piroxicam and opioid after total hip replacement (17). The com- bination of systemic NSAID with a central neural block with bupivacaine and/or opioids has been studied in major abdominal (18) and thoracic surgery (19), in which additional treatment with piroxicam 20-40 mg daily did not improve analgesia during", "307": "rest, cough, or mobilization during an otherwise effective epidural low-dose bupivacaine-opioid regimen. Further studies of such triple combination therapy, especially in soft- and bone-tissue trauma such as orthopedic procedures are needed. After cesarean section the combination of low-dose epidural morphine and intramuscular diclof- enac provided analgesia superior to either drug alone (20). In experimental studies, local NSAID application for burn injuries has proven effective in reducing various aspects of the injury response as well as pulmonary complications (21), but the analgesic effect in clinical burn injury is debatable (22). No information is avail- able from local instillation of NSAID in surgical pro- cedures. Combination of systemic NSAID with intra- articular bupivacaine may reduce pain and analgesic requirements (23). So far, no NSAID has been proven superior regard- ing efficacy or side effects (12,131 and choice of prepa- ration therefore may depend on other factors, such as duration and site of administration (intravenous, sup- positories, oral, cream). Short-lasting (<1 wk) treat- ment with NSAIDs does not seem to have clinically significant side effects (12,131, except in high-risk pa- tients with hypovolemia, renal failure, active or recent gastroduodenal ulcer, or bleeding disorders (12,13). 1050 REVIEW ARTICLE KEHLET AND DAHL ANESTH ANALG BALANCED ANALGESIA 1993;771048-56 The use of other modifiers of the primary hyperal- gesic (inflammatory) response has not been evaluated in clinical postoperative pain, as far as leukotriene synthesis inhibitors, bradykinin-, substance-P-, or serotonin-antagonists, and a2-agonists are concerned. Therefore, no data are available on combination regi- mens with these drugs together with other peripheral acting analgesics. In conclusion, treatment with peripheral-acting an- algesics may be an important component of multimo- dal pain therapy in the future, but, because there is a lack of data, no firm recommendations can be given. However, the combined use of NSAID and opioids seems rational and is", "308": "supported by the available data. Peripheral Nerve Blocks The gold standard for peripheral nerve blocks is local anesthetics, and recently there have been efforts to pro- long or optimize analgesic efficacy by combining the local anesthetic with opioids or clonidine (24,25). In this respect there is some evidence from experimental iso- lated nerve studies that clonidine may enhance the ef- fects of lidocaine on C-fiber action potentials (26). How- ever, at present, the results are clinically inconclusive and recommendations can not be given. One study has demonstrated additive analgesic effects by a combina- tion of cryoanalgesia and rectal indomethacin after thoracotomy (27). Central Neural Blocks with Local Anesthetics, Opioids, and a,-Agonists The clinical data showing the additive/synergistic an- algesic effects of combining epidural local anesthetics, opioids, and a2-agonists are in accordance with results from experimental studies. Experimentally, intrathecal local anesthetics poten- tiate spinal morphine antinociception (28,29) and to- gether inhibit prolonged poststimulation discharge (wind-up) of the dorsal horn cells (30). The synergism between morphine and lidocaine also exists in visceral nociception models, and may be more profound than the inhibition of somatic nociception (31). The mecha- nism for the additive /synergistic effects between spi- nal local anesthetic and opioid effects has not been evaluated clearly (29), although bupivacaine may fa- cilitate morphine-induced antinociception by confor- mational changes in spinal opioid receptors with de- creased binding to preceptors but increased binding to 6- and K-receptors (32). Experimental studies have also shown additive effects between intrathecal opioid and a-adrenergic agonists (33-35). This has been confirmed i n more recent studies also demonstrating additive ef- fects between intrathecal morphine combined with norepinephrine, carbacol, or midazolam (36). Epidural Local Anesthetic-Opioid Combinations Morphine enhances pain relief and the spread of sen- sory analgesia during continuous epidural bupiva- caine infusion (37). Tables 1 and 2 summarize", "309": "the avail- able data from double-blind or single-blind studies, matched, or other sufficient comparative studies inves- tigating the analgesic power of continuous epidural lo- cal anesthetic with or without opioid or epidural opioid with or without local anesthetic. The interpretation is hindered somewhat by differences in design, but due to the relatively large number of studies, reasonable conclusions and directions for the use and future ap- plications of such mixtures can be made. A variable dose regimen, not always presenting exact infusion rates, has been performed in about half of the available studies (3844). High-dose bupivacaine-morphine in- fusions have been used in the studies by Hjorts~ et al. (45) and Scott et al. (46), who used doses so large that they can not be recommended for common clinical use. However, these studies are included because they are appropriate for the discussion of potential additive/ synergistic effects of combining local anesthetics and opioids. The study by Badner and Komar (431, which is negative for the combination therapy, can not be com- pared to the other studies, since a lumbar (Ll-3) epi- dural catheter with local anesthetic infusion was used, despite the fact that operations were upper abdominal or thoracic procedures. To examine whether a combination of local anes- thetic and opioid is more effective than either local an- esthetic or the opioid alone, studies have been divided into two groups: studies in which the basic analgesic solution was opioid with or without additional local anesthetic, OY studies in which the basic analgesic so- lution was local anesthetic with or without additional opioid (Table 2). In all studies in which the basic in- fusion consisted of bupivacaine, additional opioid im- proved analgesia (Table 2). On the other hand, the stud- ies using opioid as a basic analgesic solution with or without additional", "310": "local anesthetic administration do not agree, inasmuch as only three studies showed im- proved analgesia by the combination (40,42,47), whereas five studies (38,39,41,43,48), could not dem- onstrate improved analgesic power by the combination versus the opioid infusion alone. In this context, only two studies have assessed pain during rest as well as during cough, mobilization, or exercise (42,471. This is important because in both these studies, the superiority in analgesic power of the combination therapy, versus opioid infusion alone, only became manifest when pain was assessed during cough, mobilization, and exercise, but not during pain at rest (42,471.

Side Effects Regarding side effects of the different low-dose regi- mens, the relatively small size of these studies does not allow conclusions as to the clinical relevance and rec- ommendations. In most studies, respiratory depression", "313": "or orthostatic hypotension has not occurred, although the latter has not been studied sufficiently with well- defined criteria. However, in the moderate size infu- sion rate study by Lee et al. (49) the bupivacaine group had an unacceptably high incidence of motor block. Limb weakness also was found in 2 of 20 patients in the bupivacaine infusion regimens by George et al. (44). Also, two cases o f muscle paralysis were found by Bad- ner and Komar (43) in the bupivacaine infusion group o f 15 patients receiving lumbar epidural analgesia, de- spite upper abdominal and thoracic procedures. One case o f respiratory depression was found in the bupi- vacaine only group by Logas et al. (39) and in the bupivacaine-fentanyl group by Badner et al. (41) and in the sufentanil group by Mourisse et al. (42). In the only available study of the risk of adverse car- diovascular responses to mobilization and walking with or without a low-dose epidural bupivacaine- morphine combination (10 mg/0.2 mg/h), no risk was found by flzoracic epidural analgesia in patients under- going cholecystectomy (50). Obviously, similar weI1- defined studies on cardiovascular function during low- dose Zumbar epidural infusions are needed to allow clinical recommendations of optima1 dose regimens. With regard to bladder function, differences in de- sign, as well as indications for a postoperative urinary bladder catheter and time for removal, preclude any conclusions as to the most optimal combination. Inasmuch as the available data seem to indicate that the combined epidural local anesthetic-opioid therapy is most efficient on pain during function, four questions need to be answered: 1) Is continuous or intermittent therapy preferable? 2) Which local anesthetic and opi- oid should be used? 3) Where should the epidural cath- eter for the combined local anesthetic-opioid admin- istration be inserted? 4) What are", "314": "the optimal dosage regimens? Intermittent or Continuous Infusion With regard to intermittent versus continuous infusion therapy, there is probably not much difference in effi- cacy during opioid therapy, at least not with the longer-acting drugs such as morphine and diamor- phine (51,521, although similar studies are not avail- able with the shorter-acting lipophilic drugs. Local anesthetics need to be administered by an infusion (531, because intermittent injections will increase the risk of adverse effects, such as muscle paralysis, orthostatic hypotension, and bladder dysfunction, although good comparative studies are not available. Choice of Opioid Lipophilic opioids may have a segmental analgesic ef- fect, thereby hopefully limiting side effects (e.g., res- piratory depression, nausea, vomiting). However, this conclusion has not been proven by any large scale study. In one obstetrical pain study, fentanyl led to a reduced incidence of nausea and pruritus compared with morphine when combined with bupivacaine (54). An unblinded and variable dose study in major ortho- pedic surgery found more nausea and pruritus and higher Paco2 values after morphine (about 0.4 mg/h), but less sedation compared with fentanyl (about 50 pg/h) (55). Another variable dose study showed com- parable analgesia, but less pruritus after hydromor- phone, compared with morphine (56). ANESTH ANALG 1993;771048-56 Morphine (57-59) and probably diamorphine (60,61) have more analgesic efficacy when used epidurally compared with systemic administration. When using the lipophilic opioids, a comparison of epidural versus intravenous fentanyl(62-691, sufentanil(70), and alfen- tanil(71), have almost uniformly shown no significant differences in analgesic power or side effects between the two routes of administration. The choice of opioid for the epidural mixtures, therefore, may depend on other factors, such as price or availability, and in many places morphine may be the optimal opioid. The risk of late respiratory depression may be higher after morphine, but based upon the", "315": "experience with the recent low- dose, continuous infusion regimens (about 0.2 mg of morphine or about 50-80 pg/h of fentanyl), the large study from Seattle (72) and the nationwide observa- tions from Sweden (73) after higher single or multiple dose administrations, this risk must be extremely low and is probably even lower than after intermittent sys- temic opioid administration with conventional doses. Finally, late respiratory depression after fentanyl also has been reported (74), and there is no indication of a reduced risk with long-term use of sufentanil or alfentanil. The potential use of mixtures of opioids to enhance analgesia has not been evaluated, although prelimi- nary observations may suggest a more rapid onset and prolonged duration by combining epidural morphine and fentanyl or epidural morphine and sufentanil (75,761. Choice of Local Anesthetic Although few studies are available, bupivacaine is most suitable due to its long duration and absent neuro- and cardiotoxicity with low-dose infusion rates (53). Furthermore, most experience comes from this drug. Therefore, bupivacaine must be considered the drug of choice for epidural postoperative combination therapy, unless new local anesthetics will be available with a more favorable sensory/motor block profile. Site of Injection Insertion of the epidural catheter should be at the middermatomal level of the incision when local anes- thetics are used (53). This is in contrast to the use of epidural opioids, in studies in which morphine (77,78) or fentanyl (69,79) have not demonstrated significant differences between thoracic or lumbar application. Choice of Dosage Definitive recommendations for dosage can not be given before more information is available from large scale studies comparing analgesic efficacy and risk of side effects, especially the risk of orthostatic REVIEW ARTICLE KEHLET AND DAHL BALANCED ANALGESIA 1053 hypotension during early postoperative mobilization and bladder dysfunction. Also, such studies should evaluate the potential", "316": "reduction in dosage when com- bined with an appropriate NSAID or other analgesics. So far, during upper abdominal or thoracic proce- dures, a combination of bupivacaine (approximately 10 mg/h) and morphine (about 0.2 mg/h with a loading dose of 1-2 mg of morphine, dependent on age), seems to be most appropriate. This regimen may not have orthostatic hypotensive effects when used as thoracic epidural analgesia (50). During lumbar epidural anal- gesia, less local anesthetic, probably in the range of 2.5-5 mg/h, has to be used due to the risk of motor block and orthostatic hypotension, although sufficient data on the risk/benefit ratio are not available. The amount of opioids may be the same as during upper abdominal and thoracic procedures, i.e., morphine 0.2 mg/h or fentanyl approximately 50-80 pg/h. Epidural a,-Agonists and Mixtures There is considerable experimental evidence that in- trathecal or epidural a2-agonists have an analgesic ef- fect (33-35) and several single-dose clinical studies have documented postoperative analgesic efficacy when used alone or an enhanced effect when used in combinations with local anesthetics or opioids (80-83). When used epidurally, the analgesic effect of clonidine may be due not only to a segmental spinal effect, but also to absorption and a systemic effect (81). For severe pain, combinations of clonidine with other analgesics (i.e., local anesthetics and opioids) may be appropriate to increase analgesic power and reduce side effects. This may be clinically important, because clonidine has a different side-effect profile compared with opioids. Thus, hypotension and seda- tion and the lack of respiratory side effects are the most relevant. So far, only three double-blind randomized studies are available with continuous infusion of cloni- dine, either as a combination of clonidine (19 pg/h) and morphine versus morphine alone ( 8 4 ) , or comparing clonidine 25 pg/h or 50", "317": "pg/h versus low-dose mor- phine or combined morphine-clonidine (851, or com- paring a low-dose bupivacaine-morphine regimen with or without clonidine (19 pg/h) (86). The results of these studies are concordant in that the combination of clonidine and morphine improved analgesia compared with morphine (84,85) or compared with low-dose clonidine alone (85) and also when added to a low-dose epidural bupivacaine-morphine regimen (86). How- ever, hypotension was observed in all three studies. In conclusion, the addition of clonidine to epidural combination regimens will increase analgesic power, but the infusion rates studied so far (19-25 pg/h) have resulted in hypotension. Although systematic dose- response studies on the risk of orthostatic hypotension 1054 REVIEW ARTICLE KEHLET AND DAHL BALANCED ANALGESIA ANESTH ANALG 1993;77 1048-56 are not available, these findings limit the recommen- dation for continuous postoperative epidural clonidine therapy. Nevertheless, the positive analgesic results call for further combination studies using a lower dose rate o f clonidine or other a2-agonists. The use of droperidrol, a dopamine-receptor antago- nist with weak aI- and a2-agonist properties, did not improve pain relief after hip surgery when combined with morphine, but resulted in fewer side effects (87). Combinations o f Peripheral and Central Analgesic Treatment or Other Mixtures As previously mentioned, the combination of peripheral-acting analgesics (i.e., NSAID and others) with low-dose epidural regimens seems rational in more severe states of pain to improve analgesia and reduce side effects. However, only two such double- blind studies are available. These are not sufficient to demonstrate additional analgesic power via the addi- tion of piroxicam to an otherwise effective low-dose epidural bupivacaine-morphine regimen after abdomi- nal and thoracic surgery (18,191. This area definitely requires further exploration with other NSAIDs or other peripheral analgesics during different proce- dures, especially soft tissue trauma surgery, where NSAIDs may be more efficient. In", "318": "an approach combining peripherally acting anal- gesics (NSAID) together with epidural bupivacaine- morphine, the additional effect of a preoperative high- dose glucocorticoid was studied to modify various humoral mediators including pain mediators (arachi- donic cascade metabolites, cytokines) (88,89). In both of these small scale studies, a very efficient and espe- cially prolonged pain relief was observed (88,89), and were more efficient than with the epidural combina- tion therapy and NSAID alone (88). These preliminary observations obviously call for further studies regard- ing the efficacy, as well as the potential side effects, of additional glucocorticoid therapy. Conclusions and Future Directions From the available data on the postoperative use of multimodal pain therapy or balanced analgesia, this strategy seems advantageous, inasmuch as analgesic power may be enhanced. However, the expected gain by reducing the risk of side effects compared with more intensive single modality treatment, needs to be evaluated in large scale studies. Also, the optimal com- bination therapy needs to be evaluated regarding com- position and duration for the various surgical proce- dures. However, at present there is no doubt that during major surgery, continuous epidural, low-dose combination regimens with local anesthetic and opi- oid are the most effective, and provide an apparent low risk of complications. Again, the benefits obtained from analgesia and, thereby, the possibility for early mobilization hastening of convalescence and reduc- tion in hospital stay, has to be weighed against the potential risks and the cost of surveillance. Furthermore, the use of multimodal pain therapy in conjunction with effective preemptive analgesia (i.e., an- algesia given before the painful stimulus) needs to be studied, because preliminary uncontrolled observa- tions have been positive (90). Thus, the use of preemp- tive analgesia may improve, at least theoretically, the analgesic power of subsequent balanced analgesia (91), although a continuous postoperative treatment", "319": "may be more important than a short-lasting preemp- tive analgesia alone (92). Finally, the use of patient-controlled rnultimodal therapy has to be evaluated, inasmuch as most studies have used rather fixed dosage regimens, which may be sub- optimal due to the well-documented, pronounced in- terpatient variability in analgesic needs after surgery. In conclusion, the data on multimodal, or balanced, analgesia is relatively scarce compared to studies on the single modality treatment of postoperative pain. Fu- ture postoperative pain studies should include such regimens rather than to simply continue investigations of single modality treatment, although single modality treatment studies are obviously useful in the evalua- tion of new drugs and techniques. The approach that combines the consideration of peripheral and central treatment of pain, possibly in combination with pre- emptive analgesia, may contribute eventually to a post- operative course without pain, and one that provides for very early mobilization and restoration of function with subsequent reduction in postoperative morbidity and hospital stay.

E-mail: ktobias@utk.edu Abstract Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of preopera- tive administration of oral carprofen, subcutaneous ketoprofen, and local nerve block with bupivacaine in preventing postoperative pain-associated behav- ior in cats after ovariohysterectomy. Animals Fifty-two female intact cats. Materials and methods Cats received butorphanol (0.44 mg kg)1 IM), carprofen (2.2 mg kg)1 PO), ketoprofen (2.2 mg kg)1 SQ), or bupivacaine in\ufb01l- tration block (1.1 mg kg)1 SQ) before surgery. Cortisol and drug concentrations and visual analog scale (VAS) and interactive visual analog scale (IVAS) pain-associated behavior scores were meas- ured 2 hours before and 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after ovariohysterectomy. Results Cats receiving butorphanol had signi\ufb01cantly increased IVAS scores 2 hours after surgery com- pared with baseline measurements.

Conclusions and clinical relevance Preoperative carprofen and ketoprofen have effects on pain- associated behavior similar to butorphanol in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Cats receiving bupivacaine blocks may require additional analge- sics immediately after surgery. Keywords analgesia, bupivacaine, butorphanol, car- profen, cats, ketoprofen. Introduction Most veterinarians agree that ovariohysterectomy causes postoperative pain in cats (Lascelles et al. 1999). Practitioners are often reluctant to admin- ister perioperative analgesics, however, because of lack of familiarity with available drugs, concerns about side effects, or frustration with the need for record keeping of controlled substances (Lascelles et al. 1999; Wright 2002). The ideal analgesic would be inexpensive, easy to administer, readily available, long-lasting, and effective. It should have few side effects; and would require no special licensing or storage. Besides opioids and alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonists, options for controlling perioperative pain in cats include oral and injectable nonsteroidal anti-in\ufb02ammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ketoprofen (Ketofen; Fort Dodge Animal Health, Fort Dodge, IA, USA) and carprofen (Rimadyl; P\ufb01zer Animal Health, Exton, PA, USA), and local anesthetics, such as bupivacaine (Bupi- vacaine HCl; Abbott Labs, North Chicago, IL, USA) 390 Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia, 2006, 33, 390\u2013398 doi:10.1111/j.1467-2995.2005.00282.x (Hellyer & Gaynor 1998; Lamont 2002). The use of these drugs is attractive because they meet many of the above criteria. Administration of systemic or local analgesics before surgery may reduce an animal\u2019s need for postoperative pain intervention. Stimulation of per- ipheral nociceptors with surgical trauma can induce peripheral hypersensitivity and upregulation of cen- tral neuronal activity, resulting in a prolonged and intensi\ufb01ed pain response with", "329": "further stimulation of the site (Lascelles et al. 1998; Lamont 2002). Once neural pathways are sensitized, the physiologic and behavioral responses to pain may persist, even when the nerves themselves are blocked or transected (Lascelles et al. 1998). Pre-emptive analgesic administration prevents this central sensitization, thus effectively limiting pain perception. Reports of the effectiveness of pre-emptive analgesia in cats are limited (Lascelles et al. 1997; Cambridge et al. 2000; Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 2002). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of preoperative administration of oral carprofen, subcutaneous ketoprofen, and re- gional in\ufb01ltration block with bupivacaine in pre- venting pain in cats after ovariohysterectomy. We hypothesized that each of these drugs would reduce pain-associated behavior scores comparable to that of cats treated preoperatively with butorphanol. Materials and methods Fifty-two healthy (ASA1) female cats weighing >2.2 kg were included in the study, with 13 cats in each group. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and permission was obtained from the cats\u2019 caregivers before participation. Age of most cats was unknown, although all were suspected to be at least 6 months of age; two cats were at least 5 years old. Health status of the cats was evaluated by physical examination and measurement of preoperative packed cell volume (PCV) and total protein (TP) in all cats and additionally by evaluation of complete blood counts and biochemistry panels in the two older cats. Cats were randomly assigned to receive one of the following analgesics: carprofen (2.2 mg kg)1 PO) 2 hours before sedation; keto- profen (2.2 mg kg)1 SQ) after sedation; butorpha- nol tartrate [Torbugesic; Fort Dodge Animal Health (0.44 mg kg)1 IM)] after sedation; or 0.5% bupi- vacaine in\ufb01ltration block of the surgical site (1.1 mg kg)1 SQ) after anesthesia. Two milliliters of", "330": "blood was obtained for meas- urement of baseline plasma cortisol and drug concentrations 2\u20133 hours before sedation and before administration of any drugs. Baseline (preoperative) visual analog scale (VAS) and interactive visual analog scale (IVAS) scores were recorded immediately before venipuncture. Forty-\ufb01ve minutes before surgery, cats were sedated with acepromazine [acepromazine maleate; Boeh- ringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc., St Joseph, MO, USA (0.022 mg kg)1 IM)] and ketamine hydrochlo- ride [Ketaset; Fort Dodge Animal Health (4.4 mg kg)1 IM)]. Anesthesia was induced with iso\ufb02urane in oxygen, delivered by mask, and main- tained after tracheal intubation with iso\ufb02urane in oxygen. A jugular vein was catheterized with a 20\u201322 SWG, through the needle, 13 cm Te\ufb02on catheter to permit postoperative blood sampling. As described by Smith et al. (1996), lactated Ringers solution (16.5 mL kg)1 hour)1 for 2 hours) was administered via the jugular catheter, beginning after catheter placement, to provide volume replacement and cardiovascular support. For cats in the bupivicaine group, bupivicaine was admin- istered subcutaneously over a 2.5-cm distance along the midline midway between the umbilicus and pubis. All cats underwent routine midline ovariohysterectomy through a 2-cm incision by the same surgeon (KMT). Cats were placed in recovery cages in a feline ward for postoperative observation by a trained observer who was unaware of the preoperative treatment protocol. Visual analog scale and IVAS scores were recorded and then blood samples obtained at 0 (extubation), 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours after surgery. Additionally, the observer made note of cats that subjectively had poor recoveries (i.e. violent, thrashing motions or biting handlers) the \ufb01rst 15 minutes after extubation. For VAS and IVAS scores, the observer marked the estimated degree of pain on a 100-mm line, with 0 being no pain, and 100 mm being the worst imaginable pain. Visual analog", "331": "scale scores were based on observations of the cat\u2019s resting behavior. Cats that approached the cage door, arched their backs for attention, or stretched out in a relaxed position and actively groomed were considered to have VAS pain scores of 0; VAS scores of 100 would be given if cats were recumbent and open-mouth breathing or lost consciousness after anesthetic recovery.

Cats that did not object to or avoid abdominal palpation and had no \ufb02inching of skin or muscle with palpations were considered to have IVAS scores of 0. Agitated vocalization and biting during palpation or uncon- sciousness after anesthetic recovery were to be given IVAS scores of 100. The jugular catheter was then aspirated and 1 mL of blood was removed temporarily. An addi- tional 2 mL blood sample was aspirated and placed in a heparinized tube, and the initial 1 mL of blood was re-infused. The catheter was then \ufb02ushed with 1 mL of heparinized saline. The blood sample was centrifuged, the plasma extracted and stored at )20 \u0003C until blood samples from all cats were available for measurement of cortisol and plasma drug concentrations. Plasma cortisol concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay, and concen- trations of the drugs were measured with high performance liquid chromatography using modi\ufb01- cations of methods previously published (Furst et al. 1988; Willey et al.", "332": "1994; DeGraves et al. 1996; Tahraoui et al. 1996). Cats with VAS scores greater than 30 mm or IVAS scores of 50 mm or greater during postoper- ative monitoring received rescue analgesia (but- orphanol, 0.4 mg kg)1 IM) as needed. Data collected after rescue analgesic administration were not included in the statistical analysis. At the completion of the study, jugular catheters were removed and the cats were returned to their caregivers. The effects of treatment, time, and treatment by time interaction on cortisol level and VAS and IVAS pain scores in ovariohysterectomized cats were evaluated using a mixed model analysis of variance procedure (Proc Mixed, SAS version 9.0; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Cat was included in the model as a random factor. Time as a repeated measure was evaluated and removed from the model based on the )2 log-likelihood statistic, which indicated that there was no improvement in \ufb01t of the model to the data. Values for cortisol were transformed using the log base 10 in order to approximate a normal distri- bution. VAS and IVAS analog scores were trans- formed using the rank procedure due to zeroes in the data (Proc Rank, SAS version 8.0; SAS Institute Inc.). Signi\ufb01cant differences in least square means among the various levels of treat- ment, time, and treatment by time were adjusted using the method of Bonferroni. Descriptive data are reported as the mean \u00b1 1 standard deviation, with signi\ufb01cance set at p \u00a3 0.05. Results Of the 52 cats included in the study, two cats (one from the butorphanol group and one from the car- profen group) were excluded after surgery because of anemia secondary to accidental overdose of IV \ufb02uids (up to 66 mL kg)1 total dose over a 2-hour period). A third cat was given ketoprofen instead of", "333": "bupivacaine. Therefore, 14 cats received ketoprofen; the remaining groups each contained 12 cats. Mean surgery time was 12.1 \u00b1 3.9 minutes (median, 10 minutes) and mean anesthesia time was 30.0 \u00b1 19.2 minutes. Ten cats had poor recoveries, including six cats that received ketoprofen, three cats that received bupivacaine, and one cat that received carprofen. Rescue analgesia was adminis- tered 2 hours after surgery in one cat that received a bupivacaine infusion block and 1 hour after sur- gery in one cat that received ketoprofen. One cat from the ketoprofen group died 7 hours after sur- gery; results from this cat were not included in the VAS, IVAS, or cortisol data analyses. All cats had VAS and IVAS scores of 0 before surgery (baseline) and at extubation (time 0). Cats which received butorphanol had no signi\ufb01cant changes in VAS scores compared with baseline but had signi\ufb01cant increases in IVAS scores 2 hours after surgery (Figs 1 & 2; p \u00bc 0.0231). Cats receiv- ing carprofen, ketoprofen, and bupivacaine had signi\ufb01cant increases from baseline in VAS and IVAS scores 1 and 2 hours after surgery (Figs 1 & 2; p \u00a3 0.0122). In all cats, VAS and IVAS scores were not signi\ufb01cantly different from baseline 4\u201324 hours after surgery. There were no signi\ufb01cant differences in VAS and IVAS scores at any time when comparing cats that received butorphanol, carprofen, or ketoprofen (Figs 1 & 2).

Signi\ufb01cant differences in plasma cortisol concentrations were only seen in cats receiving carprofen (Fig. 3). Plasma cortisol con- centrations of cats receiving carprofen were signi- \ufb01cantly higher 1 hour after surgery compared with concentrations measured before surgery and 2, 8, 12, and 24 hours after surgery (p \u00a3 0.029). Cort- isol concentrations 24 hours after surgery were signi\ufb01cantly lower than concentrations measured before surgery and at 0, 1, and 4 hours after surgery (p \u00a3 0.0033). At 24 hours after surgery, cortisol concentrations of cats receiving carprofen were signi\ufb01cantly lower than those of cats receiving butorphanol (p \u00bc 0.039). Cortisol concentrations at other time periods were not signi\ufb01cantly different among or between groups. Peak postoperative plasma concentrations of cats receiving butorphanol occurred at 0 hours for seven cats and 1 hour for two cats. Butorphanol was detectable in the plasma of all nine cats 8 hours after surgery (Fig. 4). Peak plasma concentrations of cats receiving bupivacaine occurred at 0 hours for four cats, 1 hour for three cats, and 4 hours for one cat. Two cats had no detectable drug at any time period. Seven of nine cats had detectable bupivacaine concentrations 8 hours after surgery (Fig. 5). Because plasma concentrations of butor- phanol and bupivacaine were extremely low at 8 hours, plasma samples taken 12 or more hours after surgery from these cats", "335": "were not analyzed. Of the cats receiving carprofen, peak postoperative plasma concentrations occurred at 0 hours for one cat, 1 hour for three cats, 4 hours for one cat, 8 hours for two cats, and 24 hours for one cat. Carprofen was still measurable in the plasma in seven of seven cats 24 hours after surgery (Fig. 6). Peak postoperative plasma concentration occurred at 0 hours for all cats that received ketoprofen. No drug was detectable in 1/10 cats at 4 hours and in 3/9 cats at 8 hours (Fig. 7). Four of ten cats had detectable concentrations of ketoprofen in plasma 24 hours after surgery. Complications were seen in a 4-kg, 8-year-old Maine coon cat that received ketoprofen before surgery. Preoperative complete blood count (CBC) and biochemical pro\ufb01le were normal, except for increased total protein (9.2 g dL)1; reference range, 5.6\u20137.1 g dL)1) and decreased albumin (2.6 g dL)1; reference range, 2.7\u20136.5 g dL)1). Four hours after surgery, the cat became lethargic, tachypneic, and pale. Biochemistry pro\ufb01le and PCV/TP were repeated; abnormalities included hypoproteinemia (5.3 g dL)1; reference range, 5.6\u20137.1 g dL)1), hypoalbuminemia (1.5 g dL)1; ref- erence range 2.7\u20136.5 g dL)1), hypochloridemia (3.0 mEq L)1; reference range, 3.3\u20135.3 mEq L)1), hypocalcemia (7.7 mg dL)1; reference range, 8.2\u2013 11.5 mg dL)1), hypocholesterolemia (57 mg dL)1; reference range, 73\u2013265 mg dL)1), and hyper- glycemia (304 mg dL)1; reference range, 63\u2013 140 mg dL)1).

Post-mortem \ufb01ndings included pul- monary edema, unilateral chronic interstitial neph- ritis with estimated loss of 50% of renal tissue, and acute suppurative portal hepatitis and cholangitis consistent with ascending biliary infection or portal seeding. None of the post-mortem \ufb01ndings were consistent with acute drug toxicity. Discussion In this study, signi\ufb01cant increases from baseline in VAS and IVAS scores were seen within 1 or 2 hours after surgery. However, scores four or more hours after surgery were not signi\ufb01cantly different from baseline for any group. The average surgery time in this study (12 minutes) was relatively short com- pared with previous studies, in which surgery dur- ation ranged from 27 to 60 minutes (Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 1998, 2000; Smith et al. 1999; Ansah et al. 2002). Additionally, ovariohysterecto- my was performed by \ufb01nal year veterinary students in most previous studies (Lascelles et al. 1995; Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 1998, 2000; Smith et al. 1999; Ansah et al. 2002). Cats in our study probably suffered less tissue trauma because of the short surgery time and experience of the surgeon, and postoperative recoveries would more likely be consistent with those seen in the average small animal practice. Because objective parameters such as heart rate, respiration rate, temperature, and cortisol", "338": "concen- trations have not consistently been correlated with postoperative pain in cats, need for postoperative analgesia is often based on behavioral indicators (Smith et al. 1996, 1999; Cambridge et al. 2000). Behavioral changes associated with pain in cats, however, can be very subtle. Some cats may vocalize or thrash about, but more often cats that are in pain will rest quietly in the corner of the cage or hide from observers. Some cats will take a hunched or curled position, reacting only when the affected area is manipulated (Hellyer & Gaynor 1998; Wright 2002). Because cats may also with- draw in stressful or uncomfortable environments, pain-associated behavior changes in this species are harder to quantify with descriptive scales. Visual analog scale and IVAS scores have been shown to correlate with postoperative pain in cats, and most evaluators will include interaction with the animal and manipulation of the surgical site (IVAS) to increase the sensitivity of the scoring system (Las- celles et al. 1995; Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 1998; Cambridge et al. 2000). In our study, cats were to be assigned IVAS scores of 100 mm if they lost consciousness after anesthetic recovery. Be- cause of this de\ufb01nition, IVAS scores were 0 imme- diately after extubation because the cats showed no reaction to abdominal palpation, presumably as they were still under the effects of the anesthetic agents. Low dosages of ketamine and acepromazine were used in our study to provide sedation and immobil- ization prior to surgery. In cats, acepromazine (0.05 mg kg)1 IV) administered simultaneously with a combination of oxymorphone and butor- phanol (0.05 mg kg)1 IV each) increased the mag- nitude of antinociceptive effects of the opioids 15 minutes after administration, but did not provide signi\ufb01cantly greater threshold responses 30 or more minutes after administration of the drugs (Briggs et", "339": "al. 1998). Potentiation of antinociceptive pro- perties of NSAIDs and in\ufb01ltration blocks by ace- promazine in the cat have not been reported. The effectiveness of ketamine as an analgesic is cur- rently under debate. In humans undergoing limb amputation (Hayes et al. 2004) or tonsillectomy (Van Elstraete et al. 2004), ketamine given as an IV bolus at induction and continued as a low-dose constant rate infusion did not signi\ufb01cantly reduce acute central sensitization, incidence and severity of postoperative pain, or analgesic requirements after surgery. In another study, ketamine constant rate infusion increased mechanical pain threshold and reduced windup-like pain in humans that received morphine prior to experimentally induced burns (Schulte et al. 2004). Constant rate infusion of ketamine in dogs during and after surgery, when combined with fentanyl infusions, reduced post- operative pain behavior-associated scores in dogs undergoing forelimb amputation (Wagner et al. 2002). In cats, intravenous ketamine (2 mg kg)1) increased thermal threshold 15 and 30 minutes after administration (Robertson et al. 2003). Ther- mal threshold returned to baseline at 60 minutes but was signi\ufb01cantly decreased below baseline between 210 and 390 minutes after administration, suggesting that ketamine might cause a delayed- onset hyperalgesia. Because duration of analgesia provided by a single dose of ketamine has been reported to be relatively short and systemic avail- ability is less when it is given by the intra- Evaluation of four analgesic protocols in cats KM Tobias et al. \u0002 2006 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 33, 390\u2013398 395 14672995, 2006, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-2995.2005.00282.x by Northwestern University, Wiley Online Library on [31/08/2024].

As described by Smith et al. (1996), lactated Ringer\u2019s solution (33 mL kg)1) was administered during anesthesia and recovery to provide volume replacement and cardiovascular support. It is not known whether this dose of crystalloid \ufb02uid had any dilutional effect on plasma drug and cortisol con- centrations. In two cats, \ufb02uid rates were miscalcu- lated, resulting in signi\ufb01cant hemodilution. These cats were removed from the study. Cats that received butorphanol had no signi\ufb01- cant change in VAS scores, but did have increased IVAS scores 2 hours after surgery. It is possible that the combination of acepromazine/ ketamine HCl premedication with preoperative IM butorphanol provided sedation that masked visual behavior changes 2 hours after surgery, as pain- associated behavior was notable only after palpa- tion of the incision site. Butorphanol has agonist activity at the j receptors, which are responsible for analgesia and sedation, and at the r receptors, which are responsible for autonomic stimulation and dysphoria (Hosgood 1990). Sedative effects of butorphanol alone are variable, but are increased when combined with other drugs (Tranquilli et al. 1988; Hosgood 1990). Visual and interactive pain scores were signi\ufb01- cantly increased 1 and 2 hours after surgery compared with baseline in cats that received keto- profen, carprofen, and bupivacaine, although VAS and IVAS scores of cats that received ketoprofen and carprofen were not signi\ufb01cantly different from those of cats that received butorphanol. Bupivacaine injected perineurally can provide pain relief for 2\u2013 6 hours (Lemke & Dawson 2000; Lamont 2002). In this study, bupivacaine may have provided less analgesia compared with butorphanol because of its lack of systemic effects. Additionally, bupivacaine\u2019s onset of action is 20\u201330 minutes", "341": "(Lemke & Dawson 2000); thus, surgical stimulation of nociceptors may have occurred prior to onset of drug effects. Despite signi\ufb01cant increases in bupivacaine VAS and IVAS scores, rescue analgesics were only required in one cat in our study. Use of bupivacaine in\ufb01ltration at the incision site before surgery did not signi\ufb01cantly lower postoperative pain scores in dogs undergoing laparotomy, but did decrease the fre- quency of postoperative analgesic administration (Savvas et al. 2003). In cats that received carprofen, cortisol concen- trations were signi\ufb01cantly increased 1 hour after surgery. Cats in our study may have experienced an early increase in cortisol because of slow absorption or delayed onset of action of oral carprofen. Stress, anorexia, and pain may reduce gastric emptying time, intestinal motility, and portal blood \ufb02ow, reducing or slowing drug absorption (Jamali & Kunz-Dober 1999; Whittem et al. 2000). In our study, plasma concentrations peaked at a mean time of 5.9 hours after surgery (approximately 8.9 hours after oral administration). Although onset of action of carprofen after oral administration has not been reported in cats, delayed onset of action has been noted after subcutaneous adminis- tration in this species (Lascelles et al. 1995; Taylor et al. 1996). Cats that received carprofen in our study experienced a prolonged effect, as demonstra- ted by signi\ufb01cant reduction in 24 hour plasma cortisol concentrations compared with those measured before surgery. Elimination half-life of carprofen is 9 hours when administered orally and 19\u201320 hours when given IV or subcutaneously (Taylor et al. 1996; Parton et al. 2000). Because the pharmacokinetic\u2013pharmacodynamic relation- ship of NSAIDs is complex, peak plasma concentra- tion may not be a reliable guide for dosing strategies (Lascelles et al. 1998). Additionally, long duration of action and huge variability in elimination rates in cats make multiple dosing of carprofen dif\ufb01cult (Parton et", "342": "al. 2000). Pain scores from cats receiving ketoprofen were not signi\ufb01cantly different from those receiving carprofen or butorphanol, although cats in the ketoprofen group tended to have rough recoveries compared with other cats. In previous studies, ketoprofen provided analgesia similar to that of carprofen, meloxicam, tolfenamic acid, and bupre- norphine, and better than pethidine, when admin- istered after ovariohysterectomy in cats (Slingsby & Waterman-Pearson 1998, 2000). Ketoprofen is not usually administered before surgery because of concerns about its effects on renal perfusion and platelet function. Ketoprofen inhibits both cyclo- oxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase and has a direct inhibitory effect on bradykinin (Isaacs 1996). Inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis through COX 1 inhibition may result in decreased renal blood \ufb02ow and glomerular \ufb01ltration rate (Isaacs 1996). Ketoprofen has good gastrointestinal and Evaluation of four analgesic protocols in cats KM Tobias et al. 396 \u0002 2006 Association of Veterinary Anaesthetists, 33, 390\u2013398 14672995, 2006, 6, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-2995.2005.00282.x by Northwestern University, Wiley Online Library on [31/08/2024].

In our study we chose to use ketoprofen preopera- tively, as \ufb02uid supplementation would be initiated before, and continued after, the surgical procedure. Risk of toxicity may increase with pre-existing renal disease or hypotension secondary to anesthesia or blood loss (Isaacs 1996; Maddison 2002). One cat that received ketoprofen died 7 hours after surgery, and renal dysfunction may have played a role in its demise. Chronic renal disease in that cat was not evident on preoperative blood chemistry, although the cat had hyperglobulinemia consistent with neoplasia or chronic in\ufb02ammation (Dimski 1997). Loss of more than 75% of renal function is", "343": "required before changes in blood urea nitrogen and creatinine are seen in cats with primary renal disease (Dibartola 2000). Signs of NSAID toxicity such as gastrointestinal erosions or in\ufb02ammation and renal papillary necrosis (Isaacs 1996; Pages et al. 1996), were not noted on post- mortem examination. However, these changes may not have occurred rapidly enough to have been observed at the time of this cat\u2019s death. It is interesting to note that the cat\u2019s liver enzymes and renal blood parameters were normal after surgery, despite the pathology present in those organs. As ketoprofen is highly protein bound (Lees et al. 2003), hypoalbuminemia in this cat may have resulted in a relative overdose of the drug, poten- tially contributing to the cat\u2019s death. Because this was a clinical study with client- owned animals, we chose not to have positive and negative controls (animals undergoing surgery without additional analgesics, and animals receiv- ing analgesics without surgery). Additionally, if a nonsurgical group had been included, abdominal bandages would have been required on all cats to hide surgical incisions from the blinded observer. This could have affected the observer\u2019s ability to palpate the incision site and may have changed the cats\u2019 postoperative behaviors. In conclusion, preoperative oral carprofen and subcutaneous ketoprofen produced similar altera- tions in pain-associated behavior when compared with preoperative intramuscular butorphanol in cats undergoing ovariohysterectomy. Because of variable and possibly prolonged gastrointestinal absorption of carprofen, administration of the drug more than 2 hours before surgery may be necessary. Cats receiving bupivacaine blocks may require additional analgesics for the \ufb01rst 4 hours after surgery. While preoperative ketoprofen caused no apparent adverse effects in young, healthy, well-hydrated cats, it should be used before surgery with caution because of potential adverse effects.

Twelve cats were randomly allocated to one subcutaneous treatment group: meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg) or robenacoxib (2 mg/kg) at admission (MA, RA), at induction (MI, RI) and robenacoxib at the end of surgery (RE). All cats received the same anaesthesia protocol. Plasma renin ac- tivity (PRA), plasma creatinine, drug concentrations and serum thromboxane (TxB2) were measured sequentially. Anaesthesia significantly increased PRA, as activity at end of the surgery was higher than 2 h later (mean \u00b1 SD: 26.6 \u00b1 2.8 versus 10.0 \u00b1 3.9 ng/mL/h). PRA remained higher at 2 h post-\u00ad surgery in admission groups compared to induction groups (p = .01). Serum TxB2 was lower with meloxicam than robenacoxib (p = .001), and was lower in the MA than each robenacoxib group at catheter placement. Admission groups (16/24 from RA and MA groups) received earlier rescue analgesia than other groups (p = .033). In conclusion, the renin-\u00ad angiotensin system was activated during anaesthesia despite cyclo-\u00ad oxygenase inhibition, possibly due to hypotension or surgical stimulation. There was no effect of drug or timing on the markers of renal function but one cat receiv- ing meloxicam at induction had suspected IRIS grade II acute kidney injury.

Non-\u00ad steroidal anti-\u00ad inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective analgesics for postoperative pain; they block PGE2 production by inhibiting COX-\u00ad 2", "350": "(Ochroch et al., 2003). NSAIDs are potentially nephrotoxic as regulation of renal blood flow during hypotensive stress is dependent on prostaglandins produced by the house-\u00ad keeping form of COX, COX-\u00ad 1 (Pelligand & Elliott, 2017). COX-\u00ad 1 and COX-\u00ad 2 have been postulated to generate the signal from the macula densa to renin secreting cells in cats (Pelligand et al., 2015) and therefore COX suppression could cause postoperative renal dysfunction in a surgical patient. This may result from hypoxic damage to medullary nephrons, secondary to hypotension or hypovolaemia, which may be exacerbated by the use of NSAIDs (Jones & Lee, 2008; Sear, 2005). Acute alteration of renal func- tion is rarely documented in elective surgical procedures when NSAIDs have been administered preoperatively, presumably due to the use of perioperative supportive care (intravenous fluid administration and cardiovascular monitoring) and because the evaluation of potential renal injuries through serum creatinine is insensitive (Sear, 2005). Measuring glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the most accurate method for estimation of renal function (Finch et al., 2018) but impractical. Other clinical biomarkers of renal function have been identified in the cat; plasma renin ac- tivity (PRA), fractional electrolyte excretion, proteinuria and en- zymuria but to our knowledge have not been used to monitor the effects of NSAIDs administration during general anaesthesia (Von Hendy-\u00ad Willson & Pressler, 2011). In humans, minor increases in PRA have been documented in normotensive patients under general anaesthesia, whereas arte- rial hypotension at the time of general anaesthesia induced a long-\u00ad acting stimulation of renin release (Witassek et al., 1980). There is a paucity of literature surrounding the effect of NSAIDs on PRA and no documented studies investigating the role of PRA in anaesthetized cats undergoing surgery. In conscious cats admin- istered furosemide, ketoprofen administration has been shown to reduce the increase", "351": "in PRA, whereas robenacoxib had no ef- fect (Pelligand et al., 2015) suggesting that inhibition of COX-\u00ad 2 alone was insufficient in supressing this response. PRA would be expected to increase under general anaesthesia primarily due to a decrease in effective circulating blood volume and the role of the renin-\u00ad angiotensin system (RAAS) in renal autoregulation (DiBartola, 2012; Power & Kam, 2001) However, it is unclear whether this response would be blunted by COX-\u00ad 1 and COX-\u00ad 2 inhibition. Potentially, selectivity of NSAIDs may influence PRA values intra and post-\u00ad operatively. NSAIDs, such as robenacoxib (COX-\u00ad 2 selective) and meloxicam (COX-\u00ad 2 preferential), are routinely administered pre-\u00ad emptively be- fore elective surgeries such as ovariohysterectomies (King, Roberts, et al., 2016; Speranza et al., 2015; Steagall et al., 2022). However, human clinical trials testing the benefits of pre-\u00ad emptive NSAID ad- ministration yielded equivocal results (Costa et al., 2015). Relatively few veterinary studies have indicated a benefit of pre-\u00ad emptive NSAIDs administration when compared to postoperative adminis- tration (Fantoni et al., 2015; Lascelles et al., 1998). After subcutaneous administration in cats, maximum concen- trations (Cmax) of robenacoxib (2 mg/kg) and meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg) are achieved at 1 and 1.5 h, respectively. Absorption half-\u00ad lives and terminal half-\u00ad lives are 1.0 versus 0.55 h and 1.1 versus 25.7 h for ro- benacoxib and meloxicam, respectively (Lehr et al., 2010; Pelligand et al., 2016). If administered at induction, plasma concentrations may not reach Cmax intraoperatively, so there is a rationale for giving these NSAIDs at the time of admission rather than after induction. The aim of this study was to provide clinical evidence regard- ing administration timing of NSAIDs with differing COX selectivites. We evaluated the risk-\u00ad benefit ratio of preoperative robenacoxib and meloxicam administration versus postoperative administration, in a population of young", "352": "healthy cats, by monitoring markers of renal function, coagulation and postoperative pain. We hypothesized that (1) mild and reversible alterations of renal function would be measured intraoperatively, regardless of the tim- ing of NSAIDs administration; (2) robenacoxib would have less effect on renal function and coagulation than meloxicam; (3) postopera- tive pain scores and predicted COX-\u00ad 2 activity would be lower in cats receiving pre-\u00ad emptive analgesia, especially if administered several hours before surgery. 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was a randomized, blinded prospective clinical trial com- paring the perioperative efficacy and the safety of two NSAIDs, meloxicam (Metacam 2 mg/mL; Boehringer Ingelheim Ltd, UK) and robenacoxib (Onsior 20 mg/mL; Novartis Animal Health, UK) ad- ministered subcutaneously at different times relative to the begin- ning anaesthesia. This manuscript was prepared according to the CONSORT Guidelines (Schulz et al., 2011). 2.1 | Ethical approval The study was approved by the Royal Veterinary College Ethics and Welfare committee and was carried out under the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (project licence 70/7393). This study took place at the Beaumont Sainsbury Animal Hospital from September 2011 to November 2012.

A randomization list with block size of 5 was generated by a study nurse using the RANDBETWEEN function of Excel (Microsoft, USA). Twelve cats re- ceived either meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg subcutaneously), administered at the time of admission into the hospital (group MA) or shortly after induction of general anaesthesia (group MI), or robenacoxib (2 mg/kg subcutaneously) administered at the time of admission into the hos- pital (group RA), shortly after induction (group RI) or at the end of the surgery (group RE, acting as an intraoperative control group). The principal investigator (PI) (LP) and owners were blinded to treatment group. The PI left the room at three times when the NSAIDs could have been given; administration was performed by a study nurse cog- nizant of randomization. 2.4 | Anaesthetic protocol and monitoring The cats were sedated with 0.02 mg/kg of acepromazine (ACP; Novartis Animal Health, UK) and 0.02 mg/kg of buprenorphine (Vetergesic, Sogeval, UK) intramuscularly. After 15 min, an intra- venous (IV) catheter was placed. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol to effect (Vetofol 1.0%; Norbrook, UK). Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane vaporized in 100% oxygen (Isoflo, Abbott, UK) after endotracheal intubation using a Mapleson D in- fant T-\u00ad piece breathing system. Initial oxygen flow rate was set to 500\u20131250 mL/kg/min and then adjusted with capnography to a re-\u00ad inhaled carbon dioxide (CO2) value of 0 mm Hg. Isoflurane vaporizer dial was initially set to 2%. No halogenate monitor was available for isoflurane inspired (FIIso) and expired (Fe\u2032Iso) concentration meas- urements. Routine monitoring during anaesthesia included clinical monitoring (eye position, palpebral reflex and jaw tone) and", "354": "heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (fR) and end-\u00ad tidal partial pressure of car- bon dioxide (PE'CO2) (V8401; Smith Medical, UK). Non-\u00ad invasive blood pressure was monitored using a doppler blood pressure monitor (DOP) (Model 811-\u00ad B; Parks Medical Electronics, USA) with a size 2 blood pressure cuff on the contralateral thoracic limb to the intravenous catheter. The cats were placed on a heating mat (Carbo Tech Heating Mat; Mano Medical, France). The PI anaes- thetized every cat (anaesthesia diplomate, blinded to treatment allocation). Vaporizer dial was adjusted based on clinical changes (eye position rotated, palpebral reflex absent, jaw tone relaxed, as described by Schauvliege (2016)) and changes in HR, fR, DOP and PE'CO2. Ringer's Lactate was administered IV at 10 mL/kg/h using a volumetric pump (BD Alaris GW 800 Volumetric Pump; Becton, Dickinson and Company, UK) from shortly after induction to just before extubation. If DOP < 80 mmHg, isoflurane was reduced until jaw tone became stiff. If the cat was still hypotensive, a fluid bolus of 5 mL/kg was given over 10 min. Each routine flank ovario- hysterectomy (Fossum, 2013) was performed by a team composed of an experienced surgeon (DAH or NS) scrubbed in with a veteri- nary student. We recorded vaporizer dial, HR, fR, PE'CO2 and DOP every 5 min and computed individual time-\u00ad averaged values, as well as minimal and maximal recorded values. 2.5 | Blood and urine sample collection and handling Up to four blood samples were collected from each cat at dif- ferent time points (Table 1). Plasma sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, total CO2, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, haematocrit, haemoglobin and anion gap were meas- ured with a handheld analyser (CD8+ cartridges, i-\u00ad STAT 1; Abaxis, CA, USA). Serum total solids were measured with a refractometer. We assayed TxB2, the inactive", "355": "metabolite of TxA2, to estimate actual platelet COX-\u00ad 1 inhibition (Bergh & Budsberg, 2005). Blood samples were left to clot in glass tubes while incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h in a water bath. Serum was collected after centrifugation (2000 g for 5 min) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until analysis. TxB2 was measured with a competitive immunoassay (ADI-\u00ad 900-\u00ad 002; Enzo Life Sciences (UK) Ltd, UK) according to the manufacturer's in- structions after sample dilution. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was measured by radioimmunoassay (Gamma Coat, CA1553; DiaSorin Ltd, UK) (Syme, 2004).

A maximum of 5 mL of blood was sampled during the day of the surgery (5% of blood volume for a 2 kg cat). Predicted percentage of COX inhibition was computed from interpolation of", "356": "whole blood assay curves (Giraudel et al., 2005), using measured robenacoxib and meloxicam concentrations. As the pharmacody- namic values obtained with a whole blood assay (efficacy, potency and Hill coefficient) account for drug protein binding, in vitro in- hibitory concentrations (\u03bcM) are comparable with in vivo thera- peutically relevant concentrations (after conversion to ng/mL). However, when predicting COX inhibition from plasma meloxicam concentrations, a multiplying factor of 1.5 was used to convert to whole blood concentration (cat blood haematocrit averaged 35%), assuming that meloxicam does not penetrate red blood cells (Blain et al., 2002; Giraudel et al., 2005). A maximum of two urine samples were collected from each cat (Table 1). Manual bladder emptying following induction of anaesthe- sia meant subsequent samples were representative of the perian- aesthetic period. The first sample was collected by cystocentesis at 2 h post-\u00ad extubation. The second sample was collected by the owners at home prior to the 3-\u00ad day visit, using non-\u00ad absorbent litter granules. Urine creatinine (Jaff\u00e9 colorimetric method), urinary specific grav- ity (USG, measured by refractometry), protein, sodium and potas- sium were measured at a commercial laboratory (ILAB 600; Idexx Laboratories Ltd, UK). Urinary protein creatinine (UPC) ratio and fractional sodium and potassium excretion were calculated (King, Panteri, et al., 2016). 2.6 | Postoperative pain scoring and analgesia management Postoperative pain was evaluated solely by the blinded PI, at a minimum of three timepoints 15, 60 and 120 min, then 4, 6 and 8 h and at the 3-\u00ad day examination. Pain was assessed using visual ana- logue scales (DIVAS pain and VAS wound palpation) (Cambridge et al., 2000). Another dose of 0.02 mg/kg of buprenorphine was electively administered IV 6 h after premedication if the cat did not require rescue analgesia, or as early as 4 h after premedication if", "357": "the cat was about to be discharged. Rescue analgesia was administered if VAS wound palpation exceeded 50%, by administering 0.02 mg/ kg of buprenorphine IV ahead of the scheduled time. If patients were hospitalized overnight for analgesia concern and deemed non-\u00ad responsive to buprenorphine, methadone was administered at the discretion of the on-\u00ad call veterinarian. The time point that fol- lowed rescue intervention was recorded as time of rescue. At the 3-\u00ad day visit, 3 scores were recorded by the PI (pain palpation score, inflammation score and mobility score, scored from 0 to 3) and from owners (activity, appetite and social interaction, scored from 0 to 3) (Table S2). 2.7 | Study outcomes The primary outcome was the effect of NSAID and administration timing on the renin-\u00ad angiotensin system (monitored by PRA) periop- eratively, compared against a control group (RE) that did not receive NSAID during surgery. Sample size was computed from the effect of ketoprofen and robenacoxib on the PRA response to furosemide (Pelligand et al., 2015). We assumed the dampening of PRA stimulation by meloxicam, though COX-\u00ad 1 inhibition, was similar to the one ketopro- fen achieved. A minimal sample size of 11 cats for each group versus the RE control group was computed for a parallel design (https://\u200b app.\u200b samps\u200b ize.\u200b org.\u200b uk/\u200b ) with 80% power and a significance level of 0.05. Secondary outcome measures were: (1) platelet TxB2 relative to NSAID group and predicted COX-\u00ad 1 and COX-\u00ad 2 inhibition from mea- sured concentration, (2) postoperative pain and rescue with NSAIDs groups and timing (pre-\u00ad emptive versus postoperative analgesia) and (3) volatile anaesthesia requirement \u2013 additional analysis was per- formed to determine if timing or type of NSAID influenced the iso- flurane vaporizer dial setting. 2.8 | Statistical analysis Statistics were carried out using the", "358": "software SAS, Version 9.2.2 (SAS (2008), Cary, NC, USA). p values were two-\u00ad tailed with results considered significant at p < .05. Data relating to NSAID administra- tion timing, anaesthesia duration, isoflurane vaporizer dial setting, PE'CO2, HR, DOP and fR were presented as medians (25th\u201375th per- centile). TxB2 concentration (ng/mL) and timing of rescue analgesia are mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Variables assessed once were tested with a one-\u00ad way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the effect of the treatment group. Variables assessed multiple times were tested in a repeated measures ANOVA (RMANOVA) for the effect of treatment group, time and interaction treatment \u00d7 time; the covariance structure of repeated measurements in the same subject was taken as Autoregressive AR(1). Data were log or power transformed if that improved the normality assump- tion. The RMANOVA was then used to compare groups in a pairwise manner. According to the 2 \u00d7 2 factorial design, some contrasts were calculated, for example all robenacoxib groups versus all meloxicam groups, or all admission versus all induction versus the control group (end of surgery) or all preoperative versus postoperative. 3 | RESULTS Owners of 78 female cats were approached, and 60 cats were en- rolled and completed the study. Cases excluded prior to the study (recruitment) are documented in Figure 1. Breeds were domestic short hair (45), domestic long hair (7), domestic medium-\u00ad hair cats (2), Bengal (1), Bengal cross (1), Persian (1), Persian cross (1), Ragdoll cross (1) and Siamese cross (1).

A total of 36 cats (60%) were seen at the 3-\u00ad day visit; of these, 14 cats presented with a urine sample. 3.1 | Timing of NSAIDs administration The admission groups (MA, RA) received meloxicam 81.5 min (me- dian, 25\u201375% quantiles 67.5\u2013113.5) and robenacoxib 112.5 min (me- dian, 25\u201375% quartiles 68.8\u2013163.7) before anaesthesia induction. Induction groups (MI and RI) received NSAIDs 5 min after induction. The RE group received robenacoxib for 57 min (median, 25\u201375% quartiles 49.8\u201363.6) after induction. 3.2 | Anaesthesia monitoring and isoflurane vaporizer setting Median anaesthesia duration (25th\u201375th quartiles) for the MA group was 65 min (60\u201370), the RA group 59 min (45\u201361.25), the MI group 60 min (54.5\u201366.25), the RI group 70 min (68.75\u201376) and the RE group 55 min (48.75\u201360) (Figures S1\u2013S5). The RI group had the longest mean anaesthesia duration (70.8 min) in comparison to MI, RA and RE (p = .0318, p = .0016 and p = .0017), followed by the MA group (mean; 65.8 min), which had longer anaesthesia duration than RA (mean; 56.5 min, p = .0223) and RE (56.7 min, p = .0242). Median values for isoflurane vaporizer settings, average blood pressure, average PE'CO2, maximal recorded blood pressure, aver- age HR and average fR are presented in the Figures S1\u2013S5. There was no significant difference between the treatment groups. Individual time-\u00ad averaged vaporizer settings were not different be- tween groups (p = .45); medians (25\u201375th quartiles) were 1.95% (1.82\u20132.04) for RA, 2.00% (1.85\u20132.07) for RI, 1.82% (1.78\u20132.04) for RE, 1.89% (1.73\u20131.95) for MA and 1.94% (1.84\u20132.03) for MI.

Thirty-\u00ad seven cats experienced hypotension despite the high fluid infusion rate; the hypotensive episode lasted a median of 15 min (25th 75th percentile, 5\u201325 min). Most cats became normo- tensive after the first surgical incision (for two cats within 5 min and 10 cats within 10 min after the first incision). One cat that remained hypotensive for 35 min after first incision received a fluid bolus. 3.3 | Renal parameters monitoring There was no significant difference in plasma creatinine between treatment groups at any time point (Figure 2a, Table 2). One cat in the MI group had a 0.8 mg/dL increase in serum creatinine (admission 1.4 and 2.2 mg/dL at 3-\u00ad day visit), consistent with an International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) grade II acute kidney injury (Cowgill, 2016). Although this discovery was incidental and sub-\u00ad", "361": "clinical, plasma creatinine was still within the reference range (1.0\u20132.2 mg/dL); a subsequent visit was organized at which the cat was clinically normal and serum creatinine had returned to the pre-\u00ad anaesthesia value. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was significantly higher at extubation compared to 2 h postextubation (p < .0001), regardless of treatment group (Figure 2b). The PRA for the control group (RE) at extubation was not different than that of any other treatment. Compared to the MI group, the PRA for the RA group was lower at extubation (p = .029), then higher at 2 h postextubation (p = .036). At 2 h postex- tubation, PRA remained higher in admission groups (MA + RA) com- pared to induction groups (MI + RI) (p = .01). Haematocrits total solids, USG, UPC and fractional sodium ex- cretion were not significantly different between the sample time and treatment groups. However, fractional potassium excretion was higher at 3-\u00ad day in RE compared to MA (p = .0265), MI (p = .0470), RA (p = .0042) and RI (p = .0123).

The % predicted COX inhibition was calculated from the interpolation of whole blood assay curves (Giraudel et al., 2005; Giraudel et al., 2009) using measured concentrations of robenacoxib in blood and meloxicam in plasma. As the pharmacodynamic values obtained with a whole blood assay (efficacy, potency and hill coefficient) account for drug protein binding, in vitro inhibitory concentrations (\u03bcM) are comparable with in vivo therapeutically relevant concentrations (after conversion in ng/mL). However, when predicting COX inhibition from plasma meloxicam concentrations, a multiplying factor of 1.5 was used to convert to whole blood concentration (cat blood haematocrit averaged 35%), assuming that meloxicam does not penetrate red blood cells (Blain et al., 2002; Giraudel et al., 2005). 13652885, 2024, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jvp.13427, Wiley Online Library on [31/08/2024].

At 2 h postextubation, serum TxB2 con- centration for MA was lower than RA (p = .004) and RI (p = .008) and serum TxB2 concentration for MI was lower than RA only (p = .03). 3.5 | Circulating NSAIDs concentrations and predicted COX inhibition Plasma meloxicam and blood robenacoxib concentrations at extuba- tion, 2 h after extubation and 3 days are presented in Table 3. Although circulating concentrations of NSAIDs were not measured at catheter placement, the concentrations of meloxicam for both groups at extu- bation (MA: 638 ng/mL, MI: 369 ng/mL) and 2 h after extubation (MA: 737 ng/mL, MI: 775 ng/mL) were predicted to inhibit between 26% and 35% of COX-\u00ad 1 activity (Giraudel et al., 2005). Meloxicam maximal pre- dicted COX-\u00ad 2 inhibition was 53% and 57% for MA and MI at 2 h after extubation, respectively. For the robenacoxib admission and induction groups, the concentrations at extubation (RA: 534 ng/mL, RI 933 ng/ mL) and 2 h after extubation (RA: 103 ng/mL, RI 286 ng/mL) were con- sistent with the ones from conscious cats (Pelligand et al., 2016). These peri-\u00ad operative concentrations were predicted to inhibit between 2% and 16% of", "367": "COX-\u00ad 1 activity (Giraudel et al., 2009). Maximal predicted COX-\u00ad 2 inhibition was 77% and 95% for RA and RI at extubation, re- spectively, and 58% at 2 h after extubation in the RE group. 3.6 | Early postoperative pain assessment Eight of 12 cats in the RA and MA groups required rescue analge- sia, versus 5/12 in the RE and MI groups and 4/12 in the RI group (Figure S6). Admission groups received buprenorphine earlier (MA and RA both 2.6 h) than induction groups (MI 4.0 h, RI 4.2 h, p = .033), but the rescue proportion between admission and induction groups did not reach significance (p = .08). There was no difference in rescue rate between NSAIDs (p = .79). There was no statistically significant difference in DIVAS be- tween groups for different times or treatment groups in the postop- erative period. However, VAS wound palpation at 15 min was lower for the control group (RE) compared to preoperative groups (p = .01), regardless of the NSAID. Two cats (RA RE groups) were kept in the hospital overnight for additional methadone analgesia, and one cat (RI) was re-\u00ad admitted the next day for overnight hospitalization (received buprenorphine and robenacoxib oral). 3.7 | Three-\u00ad day examination Re-\u00ad examination at day 3 occurred in 20/36 and 14/24 cats admin- istered robenacoxib and meloxicam, respectively (Figures S7\u2013S9). Veterinary assessment scores, appetite and social interaction owner scores did not significantly differ between groups. Owner activity scores were higher (worse) for cats in the induction group (MI + RI) when compared with the admission group (MA + RA) (p = .005) and the RE control (p = .005). 4 | DISCUSSION This is the first prospective, randomized blinded study investigating PRA as a specific renal marker in relation to the safety of NSAIDs", "368": "administered around neutering. We found there was no effect of NSAIDs, timing or type of NSAID on the markers of renal function. Interestingly, PRA was increased in all groups after surgery, as extubation values were significantly higher compared to 2 h there- after. Unexpectedly, there was no difference between the PRA val- ues in the control group (RE) and the induction/admission groups. Jepson et al. (2014) reported median PRAs of 0.52 ng/mL/h (25th\u2013 75th quartiles, 0.28\u20131.02) in non-\u00ad azotaemic, non-\u00ad hypertensive cats. In eight young healthy cats fed low-\u00ad sodium dry food, Pelligand et al. (2015) measured baseline PRA at 1.89 ng/mL/h \u00b1 SD 0.82. The PRA values measured 2 h postoperatively were still higher than the baseline values of these two studies, despite the administration of IV fluid. The renin-\u00ad angiotensin system must therefore have been activated during anaesthesia independently of cyclo-\u00ad oxygenase inhibition, possibly due to hypotension or surgical stimulation. This has been shown in dogs and humans, in which beta-\u00ad adrenoceptor blockade causes a suppression of plasma renin, indicating that renal sympathetic innervation is also involved in this response (Cambridge et al., 1992). PRA was higher at 2 h after the end of the surgery in admission groups compared with induction groups. This could be due to higher circulating levels of NSAID at this time point in the in- duction groups and more suppression of prostaglandins or reduced efficacy of the admission NSAID group. When comparing robena- coxib and meloxicam, there was no difference in renal markers at any time point, demonstrating they were equally safe in our population of cats undergoing routine ovariohysterectomy. This is in agreement with one study comparing meloxicam and robenacoxib for cats un- dergoing orthopaedic surgery, which found no difference in adverse events or biochemistry variables (Speranza et al., 2015). However, the", "369": "sample size was too small to detect differences in potential un- common adverse events. We interpreted DOP as invasive femoral systolic pressure minus 14 mmHg following Grandy et al. (1992), hence time-\u00ad averaged blood pressure appeared relatively well-\u00ad maintained during anaesthesia. However, minimal Doppler pressures could act as a confounding factor influencing perioperative PRA, as minimal DOP was very low in some of the groups, in particular MA (57.3 mmHg). 13652885, 2024, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jvp.13427, Wiley Online Library on [31/08/2024].

Inspired isoflurane concentrations did not differ between groups. Our hypothesis that cats in the end-\u00ad of-\u00ad surgery (RE) group may require higher inspired isoflurane concentrations was not supported. It is possible that this study was underpowered for this comparison. Admission groups (RA + MA) required earlier rescue analgesia than induction (RI + MI) or control (RE) groups, but the proportion of rescues between groups did not reach statistical significance. Similarly, 3-\u00ad day visit activity and social interaction scores were worse for admission compared to the induction and control groups. This is an unexpected finding, as one would assume that pre-\u00ad emptive NSAID several hours before noxious stimuli would give greater post- operative benefits. In the groups (MA + RA), the administration of rescue analgesia occurred 2 and 3 h post Tmax for meloxicam and robenacoxib, respectively. With robenacoxib, the predicted COX-\u00ad 2 inhibition at 2 h post-\u00ad extubation was consistently lower in the RA group compared to the RI and the RE group (Table 3), hence possi- bly contributing to the earlier rescue in the RA group compared to groups where robenacoxib was administered post-\u00ad induction. With meloxicam, predicted COX-\u00ad", "370": "2 inhibition at extubation and 2 h there- after did not differ between the MA and MI groups (Table 3); thus, it does not explain the superiority of administration at induction rather than at admission. Serum TxB2 concentrations were significantly lower in the meloxicam group, as expected, since meloxicam is only preferen- tially selective for COX-\u00ad 2, whereas robenacoxib is highly selective. According to measured circulating NSAID concentration, the pre- dicted level of COX-\u00ad 1 inhibition at extubation was 26\u201338% with meloxicam groups and reached 34\u201335% 2 h thereafter, but never exceeded 16.5% in any robenacoxib group. It did not result in any haemostasis problem at the time of surgery. However, based on our data, if there is a clinical risk of haemorrhage or platelet dysfunc- tion, the use of robenacoxib might be considered over meloxicam. A randomized study in healthy cats supports this; cats were given high-\u00ad dose robenacoxib for 28 days with no change in activated par- tial thromboplastin clotting time (King et al., 2012), and no change in buccal mucosal bleeding time was observed in cats and dogs un- dergoing soft tissue or orthopaedic surgery with robenacoxib (Gruet et al., 2011, 2013; Sattasathuchana et al., 2018). This study has some limitations. Although GFR is the gold standard for assessing renal function, this was not feasible in this setting. Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) was also not avail- able when the study started. PRA, creatinine, UPC and urinary excretion fractions were chosen as these have been shown to be more sensitive markers than creatinine alone (Finch et al., 2018). Different surgical teams could induce more or less nociceptive stimulation than other teams; however, (1) the cat allocation to treatment and surgical team was random and (2) the students were closely supervised by the veterinary surgeon, reducing pos- sible differences in", "371": "intraoperative stimulation. Students were allowed 20 min to operate, beyond which the surgeon took over the procedure. Pain recognition is not a simple task in cats due to their inability to self-\u00ad report (Mathews et al., 2014). Two visual analogue pain scores were used to assess postoperative pain in this study and these have some limitations. Newer systems such as the validated Botucatu scale (Brondani et al., 2013), the Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale \u2013 Feline (Reid et al., 2017) or the Feline Grimace Scale (Evangelista et al., 2019) may have better as- sessed pain but were not available at the time of the study. Use of these in future studies could help to differentiate postoperative pain more clearly. An owner-\u00ad based scoring system was used to as- sess pain-\u00ad related behaviour at home, and this had inherent limita- tions. Unfortunately, some cases were lost to follow-\u00ad up, meaning small numbers of cases were available for analysis, potentially risk- ing a type 2 statistical error. Serum TxB2 was measured as an index of COX-\u00ad 1 activity; lower values should result in reduced platelet activity and inhibition of primary haemostasis; thromboelastogra- phy may have provided a closer representation of in vivo haemo- stasis (Burton & Jandrey, 2020). Controversy still exists around the timing of NSAID administra- tion and neutering. This study was designed to replicate a clinical scenario and provide evidence to rationalize the use and timing of NSAID medication perioperatively. In this study, cats from the ad- mission groups required earlier analgesia compared to the induction or end-\u00ad of-\u00ad surgery groups and renal parameters were not influenced by the timing or type of NSAID. Anecdotally, one cat receiving meloxicam at induction had suspected IRIS grade II acute kidney in- jury on the day 3 sample.
